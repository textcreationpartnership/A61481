            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <label>Ver. 25.</label> But Abraham ſaid, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were preſent at our Saviour's <hi>Conference</hi> with his Diſciples, in the former part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> were ſo netled at his <hi>pithy and home diſcourſe,</hi> that they mocked at, and derided him, <hi>viz</hi> becauſe he exclaimed againſt thoſe ſins they were ſtrongly prone to, and wilfully allowed themſelves in; namely, <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102510:5"/>
               <hi>Uncharitableneſs:</hi> He therefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their Folly, and, if poſſible, to reduce them to a more generous and humane frame of Spirit, uſhers in <hi>a very notable and affecting Parable,</hi> adorned with illuſtrious Inſtances, and furniſhed with <hi>memorable Characters: There was,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a certain noble Man, who lived ſoftly, had many Attendants, full Tables, a ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, every thing that was great, good, and deſirable in this Life.</hi> And there was a poor indigent Man, called by the Name of <hi>Lazarus, deſtitute of a comfortable Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Belly pinched with hunger, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits languiſhing for want of reviving draughts, his Countenance dejected and fading, and his Fleſh being expoſed to ſtreſs of Weather, not having wherewith to defend it from boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Winds, and other common Contingencies, broke out into <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers and putrifying Sores. This miſerable Creature makes to the rich Man's Seat, and fills his Courts with the doleful Cries of a languiſhing Soul; he begs, not for Dainties and ſumptuous Diet, but only for waſte Bread, the refuſe of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; or rather for the Crumbs which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fall under the Table at Meals. This was the poor Man's requeſt; that which is ſwept up with the reſt of the litter, and thrown out of Doors to the Dunghil, was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102510:5"/>all that this diſtreſſed</hi> Lazarus <hi>moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately deſired, to allay the gripes and gnawings which ſharp Hunger had created within him:</hi> But though his Neceſſities were ſo preſſing, his Requeſt ſo modeſt and reaſonable, and his Sores ſo angry and painful, (enough to have melted down an obdurate Heart into pity, and to have obliged the meaneſt Perſon to have ſpared from himſelf, and nouriſhed ſuch an afflicted Soul,) yet this avaricious and impregnable Wretch turns a deaf'ned Ear, caſts a diſdainful Eye upon, and <hi>brow-beats this trembling Beggar,</hi> and baſely denies him that which his menial Servants ſcornfully rejected. The Dogs which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are curriſh and ſnarling, ready to ſnap at, and fly upon Strangers, <hi>here change their Nature, and, as it were, expreſs their Pity by doleful howlings;</hi> and, as if this was too little, <hi>medendi gratia linguas ſuas accommodant,</hi> run haſtily to him, and endeavour the Cure of his Wounds by licking them with their ſoft and eaſie Tongues: Thus theſe Creatures ſupplied the Neceſſities of afflicted <hi>Lazarus,</hi> by the inſtinct of Nature, more than their Maſters by all the Tyes and Obligations of Reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102510:6"/>
            <p>He was bleſt with a <hi>flouriſhing Eſtate,</hi> nothing that the World eſteemed good, great, and deſirable, was with-held from him; ſo that ſince Providence had thus undeſervedly crowned him with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Revenue, he could not, unleſs wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the <hi>Womb of Ingratitude,</hi> have denied a ſmall part of ſo vaſt an Income to this <hi>importunate Beggar;</hi> much leſs have refus'd him that inconſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his, namely, <hi>The crumbs which fell from his Table;</hi> ſuch Offel which his Dogs blowed upon: But brutiſhly forgetting from whence his Riches ſprang, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily fixing his Heart upon them, concludes it Prodigality and ill Husbandy to part with any thing, though it were but a Rag to cover the Fleſh, or a morſel to ſuſtain the Hunger, or a draught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the languiſhing Spirits of a fainting Soul. <hi>Such dangerous temptations are Riches, if Men are not guarded with Grace, and well conſider the Deſign of God in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</hi> Hence our Saviour pronounces, That <hi>it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Not that Riches are Evils in themſelves, but they become ſuch by an imprudent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, when Men ſuffer their Hearts

They are commonly Bleſſings; they were ſo to <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> to <hi>Job, David,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> but ſuch was the ſtupid brutiſhneſs of this Miſer, he contracted ſuch an inordinate love to his Eſtate, that he had quite loſt all Humanity and Compaſſion: His only care was to keep what he had, drowning his Senſes in Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, and all kinds of Senſuality, never once think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a life to come; but <hi>O ſad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, and diſmal change of Things!</hi> Riches, tho' they defend from Hunger, Thirſt, and other exterior contingencies, yet they cannot bribe, and ſtave off Death, neither inſinuate with the Judge Chriſt Jeſus for a favourable Trial, nor purchaſe a Manſion amongſt the Saints; <hi>he dies, and awakes in the midſt of ſoorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames, and bituminous ſmokes,</hi> ſcar'd at the gaſtly Spectrums and hideous Noiſes he meets with among Devils and damned Fiends. <hi>Lazarus alſo dies, and is carefully conveyed into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s boſom,</hi> a ſafe Repoſitory, and never to Hunger, Thirſt, and want more: But this I ſhall treat of in its proper place.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>A brief Narrative of a Rich Man's General Courſe of Living;</hi> he cloaths himſelf with rich, gay, and coſtly Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fareth ſumptuouſly every Day. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Part is, <hi>A deſcription of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that attend Poverty; Lazarus</hi> was full of Sores, almoſt Naked and Famiſhed, he begs for a little Suſtenance, and that of the meaneſt kind, but was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably denied it. Now theſe two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals demonſtrate to us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, <hi>That Riches are ſtrong incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Luxury and Riotouſneſs;</hi> this Rich Man fared Sumptuouſly every Day, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained himſelf every Day with Luxurious Delights.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Riches tempt to Pride, Haughtineſs, and Uncharitableneſs.</hi> This Elated Miſer thought it beneath his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, either to look upon, or commiſerate afflicted and languiſhing <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and therefore chides him by his <hi>Menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and ſends him away empty as he came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Poverty is a deſpicable State, and renders a Man moſt vile and mean in the Eye of others,</hi> how much ſoever good he hath heretofore done with what God had bleſſed him with.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102510:7"/>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>three Topicks</hi> which will be the Subject of my enſuing Diſcourſe; only by the way it may not be improperly inſerted, That by the <hi>Rich Man, and Poor Lazarus,</hi> is figured out to us the different ſtate of good and bad Men in this Life: Good Men, for the moſt part, are in mean and low Circumſtances, and of ſmall Account, but are rich towards God, precious in his ſight, and have their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion treaſured up with him, according to that of St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. 2.5. God has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Poor of this World heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>The Wicked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flouriſh,</hi> the World's affluences tumble in upon them, but they have their Portion in this Life; hereafter Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt, ſhall be the Portion of their Cup, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Riches are ſtrong Incentives to Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Riotouſneſs.</hi> This Noble-man fared Sumptuouſly every Day; he obſerved no Intervals for Mortification, no time for holy Retirement, for a ſtrict Examination of himſelf, for <hi>Prayer, Repentance,</hi> and other neceſſary Duties: Nor was he ſo Morally uſeful to others as was St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> who divided the Day into ſpecial Portions for needful buſineſſes; to <hi>reconcile
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102510:8"/>diſturbed Families, and linck together enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Neighbours in the Bonds of Amity, to obſerve and miniſter to the Neceſſities of the Indigent, to inſtruct the Ignorant, counſel the leſs wary;</hi> and ſuch like. No, no, this wealthy Wretch lived every Day to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, delighting his Palate with luſcious Viands, and <hi>Falernian</hi> Liquors, loading his Stomach with Morſels, without any regard to Moderation; had no thoughts of, nor any earning bowels, after thoſe who wanted, and would be glad of the meaneſt bit at his Table. After this Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner did he ſpend every Day; <hi>ſuch ſtrong and irreſiſtible temptations are Riches, when Men are without Grace, and conſider not the wiſe and holy purpoſe of God in beſtowing them;</hi> for tho' they are the proper and peculiar Gifts of Heaven, and were promiſed to, and beſtowed upon our Forefathers, as illuſtrious inſtances of the Divine favour, yet they are not to be proſtituted ſolely to our ſelves, that is, to nouriſh and maintain our Luſts, for then they change their nature, and prove the manifeſt ruin of Soul and Body. Upon which account, it may not be improper to inſert this <hi>Memorandum,</hi> That they who are bleſs'd with Plenty and Store, ought to be very importunate with God, that he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102510:8"/>would <hi>moderate, and rectify their Appetites, keep and reſtrain their Hearts, curb and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Deſires, that they may not be ſo taken up, and charmed with their Wealth, as to forget the Concernments of their Souls, and ſuffer them to live out a long Eternity with the Damned Crew, in the unhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidences of Miſery.</hi> Therefore our Saviour, ever and anon, is giving a ſpecial charge to Rich Men, that they be very cautious and wary, leſt they ſhould be Inchanted, and betrayed by Superfluities, which, like the <hi>Syrens,</hi> whom the Poets ſpeak of, as it were, lie in wait for Men, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them by their pleaſing, and almoſt irreſiſtible Charms. It was an excellent Prayer that of <hi>Agurs,</hi> Prov. 30.8, 9. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: Leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having weighed in an even Ballance both a proſperous and an adverſe ſtate, and conſidering what inconveniencies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of either condition would bring men into; the one tempting them to Luxury, Drunkenneſs, and Gluttony, the other to Theft, Lying, and Perjury; Proſtrates himſelf before God, with recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102510:9"/>deſires, a moderate appetite, and an humble heart, and beſeeches him to bleſs him with a condition neither too wealthy, nor too deſpicable; to the end he might not be prompted to ſuch enormous ſins. <hi>When Riches are enjoyed without a juſt ſenſe and fear of God, they leadmen into manifold extravagancies;</hi> the appetite which once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was corrective, &amp; as ſcanty as a mean competency, now enlarges it ſelf, &amp; grows as comprehenſive in its wiſhes as the Eſtate abounds; Now the heart is fixed upon its deſired Treaſure; and no leſs taken with all the pleaſures and ſeemingly delights it can procure and purchaſe, to violate a divine Commandment; when obedience thereto ſtands in competition with Money, is thought no ſin, but rather a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of policy and prudence. In a word, and to borrow the expreſſion, <hi>The love of Money ſpends all its deſires upon its ſelf to purchaſe nothing but unſatisfying inſtruments of Exchange, or Supernumerary Proviſions; and ends in emptineſs of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Rich man in the Text ſpent all his thoughts how he might advance to the height of an Epicures Life; what ſhall I eat? or what ſhall I drink? or what ſhall I put on? The world ſeemed too little to anſwer his greedy deſires; too
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102510:9"/>empty to furniſh his Table with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, his extended appetite moſt paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately craved after. His Eſtate was large, and his Mind anſwerable; nay, rather more diffuſive: So that though he was plentifully accomodated with the <hi>ſublimeſt rarities,</hi> yet he ſtill ſeemed unſatisfied; but ſure this is not the end of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God has not deſigned us meerly for theſe lower entertainments. Our Spirits are capacious Beings, of eternal duration, and muſt live in another world for ever; after this is conſumed. Where then is thy policy? <hi>O Dives! Where is the ſenſe of thy Voluptuous faring?</hi> Thou muſt not always abide here; thy Riches, Honours, and Luſcious Delicates, all muſt periſh and thou <hi>ſtript into a naked Spirit,</hi> and anſwer for all thy Tranſactions at the Tremend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bar of Juſtice, where neither thy Wealth nor Grandeur can procure thy <hi>favour with Judge or Jury;</hi> the meaneſt Peaſants ſhall then be as great as thou, and find as much receptance at that <hi>Grand Aſſiizes.</hi> But to proceed to the ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as Riches are ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to Luxury and Riotouſneſs, ſo to <hi>Pride, Haughtineſs and Uncharitableneſs.</hi> This wealthy Miſer thought it too great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102510:10"/>upon his Dignity and Perſon, to look upon, or commiſerate afflicted <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> and therefore he imperiouſly charged his Servants to forbid him begging, and to ſend him away empty as he came.</p>
            <p>He conſidered that ſuch an Eſtate as he was poſſeſſed of, called for <hi>lofty looks, a starched carriage, big words, and full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, a viſible ſeparation of himſelf from his inferiours;</hi> and that which enhanſed his Eſtate, ſpeaking to others by the mouth of his Servants, being difficult of acceſs, and carrying it in all things with Majeſty, Pomp, and an imperious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. It had therefore been a viſible ſlur upon his Perſon to have ſeemed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the complaints of poor <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to have ſtepped from his ſeat, and viewed this <hi>Begger's Condition,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſupplies for him. Should he, who was advanced to the very top of honour and magnificence; he, who had attendance always at hand, whoſe grandeur was noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abroad, and became the <hi>wonder and admiration of the Neighbouring Villages;</hi> he whoſe cloathing was Royal Purple, whoſe Linnen the Richeſt that <hi>Acaiah</hi> could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with; he whoſe Preſence was the Terrour of his Houſhold, and the aſtoniſhment of the Vulgar; Should ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102510:10"/>a one, thus <hi>incircled with the rareſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of fortune,</hi> ſo far demean himſelf to ſtoop to a Perſon fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of Diſgrace, attended with all the Inſtances of Contempt and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as was dejected <hi>Lazarus?</hi> No, no, let him away from my Gates, and get his Belly full at ſome Cottage or other. Thus Riches are apt to make us forget our ſelves, they Intoxicate our underſtanding, and Prompt us to over-rate our ſelves; they lift us up above our Sphere, and lead us to contemn and ſlight thoſe who are not in ſuch fortunate circumſtances as our ſelves. Common Experience gives us too many, and palpable Inſtances of this kind; ſome who through <hi>meanneſs of Perentage,</hi> or other unhappy Contingencies, have lived in an Ordinary Capacity, and while thus bereaved of Fortunes, Ciſts, poſſibly were Humble, Meek, and Condeſcending, forward to aſſiſt when uſeful, and apt to be affected with the calamities, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſities of others; but when the tide has changed, either their Induſtry bleſt to a plentiful Eſtate, or they ſtarted into a wealthy Condition, by the <hi>laſt Will and Teſtament of a deceaſed Friend, or familiar Acquaintance,</hi> their diſpoſition has changed to. Now their late Tranſlation ſpeaks
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102510:11"/>greater things; their Converſation muſt be with thoſe who are of the ſame Rank and Quality with themſelves. Now their wonted Apparel, which was plain and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Condition, muſt be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mode and Figure, ſet off with <hi>curious Trimmings,</hi> and <hi>faſhionable Appurtinances;</hi> their Carriage more Airy and Affected; their Countenances more Elevated and Stately; their Speech more Majeſtick and Uncooth, <hi>former Acquaintances must be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion,</hi> the poor not worthy of their notice, or at leaſt have nothing to ſpare for them; their Pride and Grandeur muſt be maintained; but what an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate caſe is this, <hi>that men ſhould forget from whence they are,</hi> and value themſelves ſo much upon ſuch unconſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing things as Riches are? what art thou the better for thy wealth? wherein doſt thou exceed thy meaneſt Brother? Reckon not upon wealth, for God is no reſpecter of Perſons. A Beggar, it may be, is more in God's favour than thou, and ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the vail to joy and feaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ever with thoſe rare, unſeen repaſts which Divine Wiſdom has contrived for thoſe who expreſs their <hi>Love and Loyalty to him,</hi> whilſt thou ſhalt be dragged away by the common Accuſer, and his Angels,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102510:11"/>into the Repoſitories of ſhame and ſorrow, there to ſuffer the uttmoſt heats of a Sin-revenging God.</p>
            <p>But beſides the ſtupid folly of being puffed up in conceit becauſe thy <hi>Lot is fallen in a fair Heritage;</hi> Daily experience almoſt evinces us, that Riches are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Pleaſures, like unto the <hi>flower of the field, which to day is, blown, gay, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and to morrow faded, and fit for nought but to be heaped together with the graſs: Thou calleſt thy ſelf to day a ſubſtantial, wealthy Perſon; Houſes in abundance, Lands large, and fruitful, Baggs full, and running over, but by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row perhaps thou mayeſt be weeping to ſee thy Tenements laid in Aſhes, thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſnatch'd away by the ſilent crafty Thief, or perhaps, thou weeping, ſighing, and <hi>roaring in Hell;</hi> thou knoweſt not but the Sentence is gone forth from God; <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> But if it ſo falls out, that thou ſhouldſt out-live thy Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſee thy ſelf ſtripp'd of all thy <hi>Pomp and Riches,</hi> thou mayeſt juſtly expect to meet with hard and ſevere uſage; for, (beſides the many Reflections which would certainly be caſt upon thee, that this ſad
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102510:12"/>Cataſtrophe, and diſmal change of things, is a juſt Judgment upon thee for thy <hi>Pride, Arrogance, Self-conceitedneſs, and Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs,</hi> during thy Proſperity,) Men would be ſo far from pittying thy down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and conſidering thy neceſſities, that rather they would reproach thee for thy Poverty, and laugh at thy Calamities. <hi>The World is apt to remember faults,</hi> and never at a better time, than when Men are fallen to decay, and ſtand in ſpecial need of common help, then the generality lay their heads together, and <hi>recount as many failings,</hi> which may harden them againſt a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſpoſition; but enough for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond general thing, namely, That <hi>Riches are ſtrong Temptations to Pride, Haughtineſs, and Uncharitableneſs.</hi> The other remaining Topick, namely, That <hi>Poverty is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable ſtate,</hi> and renders a Man moſt vile and mean in the Eye of the World; drawn from the miſerable condition of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the baſe uſage ſhewn him in his Low Circumſtances By the Rich Man, ſhall be my buſineſs the next opportunity. I now proceed to make ſome ſpecial Uſe of what hath been ſaid at this time, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>firſt Uſe</hi> is; That if Riches are ſuch Lures and ſtrong Temptations, it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102510:12"/>ſhould ſerve for an Admonition to thoſe who are bleſſed with them, <hi>that they do not ſet too great a value upon them, nor hugg them with too much eagerneſs and deſire;</hi> that they labour to make their love of Wealth ſubſervient to their love of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and heavenly things, that they learn to admire and adore their Creator, who has caſt their Lott in a <hi>fair Heritage,</hi> and rightly underſtand his wiſe and holy Purpoſe, in crowning them with Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, that Riches are not given to ſpend them upon our Luſts, to <hi>live ſumptouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day,</hi> to trifle our time in eaſe, Idleneſs, and ſecurity; this is the abuſing of Riches; No, no, they are given to more excellent ends; <hi>To encourage us in our Duty, to give our Children good Education; to help the Fatherleſs and Widow, the Oppreſſed &amp; Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> it is ſad to conſider, how Laviſh and Prodigal many are, whom fate has bleſt with plenty and ſtore, laying out vaſt ſums in <hi>beautifying buildings, dainty fare, and well furniſhed Wardrobes,</hi> and the like, while the poor periſh at their Gates: <hi>Dives</hi> was ſo taken up with his various and extravagant Diverſions, that he could ſpare no time, or rather, would not, to hear the doleful complaints of diſtreſſed <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or to ſee, conſider, and relieve his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102510:13"/>
               <hi>He was cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen;</hi> his belly filled with the beſt of Proviſions, and therefore conſidered not what it was to be <hi>Hungry, Thirſty, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Friendleſs,</hi> he was not tormented with that ſharp Thorn which ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afflicted <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he cryed, Oh! fill my craving Stomach with the <hi>crumbs that fall under thy Table,</hi> with thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous morſels, which are thy Dogs Food; I deſire not that which thou feedeſt upon; nothing elſe but the worſt bit thy <hi>Servants leave;</hi> this is my requeſt, this I ſhould be glad of, and without ſome ſpeedy relief, <hi>I ſhall faint and drop, and periſh at thy Gates.</hi> This diſmal ſtory no way affected this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable wretch, but he rather chid him for his importunity, than pitied him for his poverty. One would have thought that ſuch expreſſions as theſe were enough to have pierced the moſt obdurate heart, and to have melted it down into compaſſion; but ſuch is the unhappy proof of an heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with, and inſeparably fixed upon Riches. Let it therefore be a caveat to thoſe who are favoured with the <hi>ſmiles of fortune,</hi> that they do not reckon too much upon their proſperous condition, nor be too much in love with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>ſecond Uſe</hi> is, That ſince
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102510:13"/>Riches are apt to ſeduce and betray men, tempt them to forget God and themſelves; <hi>let thoſe whoſe fortunes are mean in the world, learn to be content in their State.</hi> They have the more leiſure to look after the concernments of their Souls, and to provide for their <hi>long Journey into Eternity;</hi> they are free from abundance of cares, fears, and troubles; they are not perplexed with contriving how to purchaſe ſuch an Eſtate, nor over-whelmed with the fear of loſing it, but have many fair opportunities of preparing themſelves for the <hi>embraces of the Father of Spirits.</hi> Therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, grudge not that thy Portion in this life is ſo narrow, if- thou art brought to a morſel of bread, to a draught of water; yet even this is enough to bear thy <hi>charges to Heaven:</hi> But if thou art not ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be Maſter of this meaner Diet, thy life will be only the ſhorter; and poſſibly God <hi>keeps thee ſhort here,</hi> that he may plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully reward thee hereafter; <hi>Heaven is ſufficient to make thee ſatisfaction for all thy ſufferings;</hi> in Gods preſence there is <hi>fulneſs of Joy, and at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> To be received into that <hi>capacious world where are all the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Joy,</hi> all the ingredients of felicity, to have all thy faculties enlarged; to the end
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102510:14"/>they may reliſh thoſe hidden Comforts, to know and underſtand the <hi>methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and to be made acquainted with the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the ſecrets of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word,</hi> to poſſeſs all that that is good, lovely and deſirable, and that for ever; The conſideration of this is enough to bear us up under the ſoreſt Tryals, and moſt preſſing Calamities. To conclude. let us all endeavour to anſwer the end of God in whatſoever condition we are; if we be Rich, <hi>let us be Humble, Meek, and Modest, Affable, Courteous, and Charitable;</hi> if Poor, <hi>Content, Thankful, and Holy.</hi> Now to the mighty Governour of the world, who loveth <hi>Mankind,</hi> and giveth to all men according to his Infinite Wiſdom, be given the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>As to the former of theſe; namely, That Riches ſtrongly tempt to Luxury and Riotouſneſs; I urged the proof of this from this <hi>Noble man's daily voluptuous fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; every day was alike,</hi> he obſerved no intervals for Mortification, no times for Holy Retirement: Religious Exerciſes were too dull and flatulent, of an unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury guſt to him, whoſe Palate could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliſh the choiceſt Proviſions; he had nothing elſe to do but to Sing his <hi>Quietus; Soul, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, for thou haſt much Goods laid up for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102510:15"/>many years.</hi> Thus many, whom Fate has bleſs'd with Plenty and Store, take up all their thoughts what rare pleaſures and gratifications they may purchaſe, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how they may accommodate their Appetites with the choiceſt and moſt ſelect Dainties; but ſeldom or never think of their Spiritual Concernments, as if theſe were ſuch inferior buſineſſes, requiſite on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thoſe of <hi>mean Fortunes</hi> to employ themſelves about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mortification</hi> to ſuch Perſons is, in a degree, as obnoxious as being ſtripp'd of their Pomp and Riches: In a word, whatſoever may put them in <hi>mind of Death, Judgment, and a future State,</hi> is as unwelcom to their thoughts, as was God's Sentence to the Avaricious Miſer in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond General head; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That Riches ſtrongly tempt to Pride, Haughtineſs, and Uncharitableneſs:</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the proof of this, from the lofty carriage of this <hi>Noble-man,</hi> his chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Beggar for his bold importunity, caſting a diſdainful Eye upon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing him from his Gates, Hungry, Thirſty, Naked, and full of Sores, as he came; as if <hi>Dives,</hi> upon hearing the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102510:16"/>doleful Complaints of Needy <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſhould have expreſſed himſelf to this effect: <hi>What impertinent and audacious Perſon is that who knocks at my Door, and fills my Ears with ſuch a Din? Shall I, who am great and honourable, richly clad, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for noted Perſons, caſt ſuch a viſible ſlur upon my Perſon and Dignity, as to change a word with ſuch a contemptible Creature, or be ſeen to take notice of one who is disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd with Rags, ſo wan and formidable, ſo peſter'd with Ulcers and putrifying Sores? No, no, let him be removed from before my Gates, and get a Belly full where he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the imperious Carriage of many towards thoſe who beg their Charity, and conclude it one of the moſt foul blots upon them, to lend an Ear to, or to ſeem affected with their mournful complaints.</p>
            <p>Thus far I went the laſt time, only adding <hi>ſome uſeful Inferences;</hi> I now go on to what remains, namely, to the third general Thing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That Poverty is a deſpicable State, or ſo accounted, and renders a Man vile and mean in the Eye of others, how much good ſoever he may have formerly done with what he had.</hi> Poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though he had a Soul as great and good as the moſt Puiſſant Monarch, (but inward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102510:16"/>are not ſo much the World's obſervation) was treated with Scorn and Infamy, becauſe his outward appearance was not comely and creditable, ſightly and faſhionable. Poſſibly, that little Cloathing he had, was <hi>Weather-beaten,</hi> and ſo ſhattered, that it could ſcarce hang about him; his Face lean, wan, and ghaſtly, <hi>(thoſe rarer adornments of Nature being faded, by the ſharpneſs of Hunger and Thirſt)</hi> his fleſh full of Blotches and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sotes, the whole Maſs of Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted and gangreen'd for want of a vivid circulation. <hi>This miſerable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> Inhumane <hi>Dives,</hi> ſcornfully rejects, and looks upon him fit for nothing elſe but to be his <hi>Dogs Companion:</hi> But remember, thou diſdainful wretch, the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when thou ſhalt be derided by the ſame <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom now thou treateſt at thy Gates with contempt and diſgrace; it is the Will of Heaven, that his Portion here ſhall be narrow and ſcanty, that his Reward, in another World, may be great and glorious, when thou, who art here Inveſted with the rareſt and moſt ſublime Accommodations, ſhalt be ſtripp'd of all, and become <hi>a Victim to his Triumph.</hi> God may permit his Servants to be ſavagely uſed, to be a Reproach, and By-word, in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102510:17"/>the World, becauſe he hath enough to make them <hi>infinitely amends;</hi> but to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the Subject, and enlarge the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, I ſhall,</p>

               <item>Secondly, <hi>The Unreaſonableneſs of this Practice.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>And,</hi> Laſtly, <hi>How infinitely we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reſpect them which are poor.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, I am to ſhew, why the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the World deſpiſe Poverty. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they are infected with wrong Notions of Things, and draw falſe Concluſions. They look upon Poverty as a Judgment inflicted for ſome Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs or other; as the Diſciples did the blindneſs which ſeized the Man from his birth, <hi>John</hi> 9.2. And, in favour to this Opinion, think it juſtifiable enough, to contemn and ſlight it. For, ſay they, if God makes Poverty a viſible Mark of his Reſentment of ſome open Indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him, it is but equal that we alſo ſhould expreſs our averſion from it. But what an erroneous and raſh Judgment this is, will appear, if we conſider, That though Poverty is the juſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable effect of Prodigality, or ill Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, by which means abundance have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102510:17"/>been <hi>reduced to a morſel of Bread, a draught of Water, Nakedneſs, and the like;</hi> yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, notwithſtanding their induſtrious Care, indefatigable Labours, early Riſings, and late taking Reſt, and all to get ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and an anſwerable competency in the World, are inviſibly fruſtrated; their ſimple and honeſt contrivances can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive to Perfection, but are blaſted and nipped in their very birth. Now the Scripture ſays, <hi>They that will not work, ſhall not eat;</hi> implying, that a plodding Head, induſtrious Hands, and honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, are the appointed means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Wealth is to be obtained: <hi>Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Providence obſtruct and hinder Succeſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; God knows Men better than they themſelves, he underſtands their Nature, and tendency of their Appetites; and poſſibly ſees, that if they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly thrive, they would be apt to forget their Creator, and impute their Subſtance to their own Induſtry: That they would be too much enamoured with the World, and place all their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in theſe lower Delights. So that, though in the common judgment of Men, this ſeems a <hi>harſh Providence,</hi> yet thus conſidered, it carries in it all the <hi>Inſtances
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102510:18"/>of Love and Mercy.</hi> Poverty therefore is not altogether a Judgment, (which is one reaſon why the ruder and more unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the World deſpiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it,) but very often the effect of God's Goodneſs; a viſible Indication of his Love to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Poverty is, Men ſet too high a value upon, and over-rate themſelves; for, while carried upon the Wings of Pride and Self-conceit, while thus elevated with great ſwelling Thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there is nothing more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mean in their Eye, than an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Man, one whom Providence has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied thoſe outward Bleſſings, which make Men of ſome Figure and Repute in the World. Hence it is that ſuch kind of Perſons <hi>affect much Homage and Obeyſance,</hi> look for humble Addreſſes, frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and all other demonſtrations of State and Grandeur, as if Nature had framed them in a Mold of a ſeparate make, and had diſtinguiſhed them from their fellow Creatures by viſible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. <hi>Poor</hi> Lazarus, <hi>how often didſt thou importune, beſeech, and intreat</hi> Dives, <hi>to look upon, and commiſerate thy languiſhing condition? How often didſt thou bow and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102510:18"/>cringe, and all to affect him with a ſence of thy Misfortunes? But what a diſdainful Eye did he caſt upon thee, thinking it beneath his Grandeur either to ſpeak to thee, or relieve thy preſent Needs? Neither thy mournful Gries, dejected Looks, mean Habit, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Sores, could work upon his Nature, or move him to a pliable and yearning Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from whence, O</hi> Dives, <hi>didſt thou ſpring? Art thou any thing elſe but Duſt? And muſt not thou return to it again?</hi> This is the end of all thy Pomp; that Carkaſs of thine, which is cloathed with Royal Purple, garniſh'd with ſoft and rich Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, pamper'd with choice Proviſions, eaſed upon a <hi>Velvet Couch,</hi> and refreſhed at Night with a <hi>Down-Bed:</hi> I ſay, that Body of thine, which takes up all thy time in Catering for it, muſt Die, <hi>be rouled in a Winding-Sheet, crouded in a Coffin, and Interred in a Scanty Grave,</hi> where the Vermin will make no diſtinction of Perſons, but thou becomeſt their prey as well as the meaneſt Peaſant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doſt thou thus over-rate thy ſelf, and ſoar ſo high above thy meaner Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince he ſhall have a Chamber in the Earth as well as thou, and is made in the ſame Mold, and compounded with the ſame Matter? There is no greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102510:19"/>that Men have forgotten from whence they came, how inſufficient of themſelves, and whither they muſt go, than when they begin to look big, ſwell in fancy, and contemn their Brethren of low degree; and this leads me in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this practice; and this I ſhall do, by ſhewing, Firſt, <hi>That this is adding affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to affliction,</hi> when Providence, for moſt wiſe, and holy reaſons, has ordained that ſome ſhall be deprived of theſe lower En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and walk about the World, <hi>Empty, Mean, and Unſightly;</hi> Deſtitute of comfortable Habitations, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Accommodations, and often for want of conſidering Things, and drawing right Concluſions; throws ſome into deſpair, as if God had marked them out by his ſevere methods here, for his Vengeance hereafter; others more Cholerick, and leſs Corrective; <hi>Vent themſelves into wiſhes for a ſudden and ſpeedy exit;</hi> (Poverty being an Inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Burden, unleſs alleviated by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Interpoſition of Grace.) I ſay, while Men are thus bemoaning their hard fate, and groaning under an adverſe providence;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102510:19"/>What greater aggravation of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery can there be, than to be ridiculed, diſpiſed, hiſſed at, and ſhamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned? doubtleſs it was an heightning addition of <hi>Jobs</hi> Afflictions, when his Friends, whom poſſibly he had obliged, when in Proſperity, loaded him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, Rejected, and Scoffed at him, while <hi>ſitting on the Dunghil,</hi> roaring for very Anguiſh, Naked, and Bereaved of outward comforts. <hi>Pity is the leaſt we can beſtow upon Perſons in Adverſity;</hi> and though it doth not furniſh them with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, yet it ſerves to allay their grief, and ſweeten their bitter Cup, it bears them up under inward diſturbances, and makes their burden ſeemingly lighter. It will greatly add to the Torments of the Damned, for that their lamentable Groans, loud Screeches, deep-fetched ſighs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant weepings, <hi>will not incline the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to compaſſion,</hi> to pity their remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition; were they pitiable Objects, it would in ſome meaſure allay the anguiſh of their doleful Lamentations, and it is certainly the rendring adverſity more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie and formidable, more Irkſome, and leſs bearable, when Men inſtead of pitying contemn and diſregard it. Again,</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102510:20"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The unreaſonableneſs of this appeareth yet farther; <hi>Hereby Men violate that Golden Rule, which obligeth to do unto others, as we would they ſhould do unto us;</hi> The which if generouſly obſerved, would prevent Hatred, Revenge, Contempt and all other diſorderly Practices: Suppoſe therefore, That from a vaſt Eſtate and height of Honour, thou wert lapſed into Poverty, and ſunk into the depth of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, wouldeſt thou be content to <hi>be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from former Acquaintances,</hi> to be ſlighted, and become the Deriſion of thy Neighbours? Wouldſt thou not rather think it cruel uſage that thy wonted great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be ſo ſoon buried in oblivion, and that thou, who wert once the <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others,</hi> ſhouldeſt now become an Object of general Scorn and Infamy? What can therefore be more unreaſonable, than for Men to mete out ſuch meaſure to others, which they would not have dealt unto themſelves? There is not any thing ſhews more a mind void of all regard to Juſtice, nor a more rude and undecent Spirit; <hi>Laberius,</hi> ſays the Poet <hi>Horace, dum Vixit, Credidit ingens pauperiem Vitium;</hi> while he lived in Splendor and Pomp, and had the world at Command, being poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a large Eſtate, looked upon nothing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102510:20"/>ſo criminal as poverty, and therefore treated In digent, needy men with great contempt and ſcorn: But when fate had altered his circumſtances, changed the face of things, and turned his wealth into emptineſs; he was ſoon of another opinion, <hi>Then Poverty was a Vertue,</hi> a ſtate which deſerved mens pity and aſſiſtance. Thus Men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt to be ſwelled in conceit while the World favours them, and to reproach a mean Station; but if it chance to be their fortune to fall into it, then nothing more unreaſonable than to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Thus we obſerve from the Common Judgment of the world, that it is both unjuſt and unequal to condemn Poverty; for though this is an uſual practice, yet not their Opinion, when fallen to decay.</p>
            <p>From hence I proceed in the third place, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, To ſhew how infinitely we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reſpect thoſe who are poor.</hi> And here, Firſt, The meaneſt Peaſants lay claim to the ſame parentage, which the moſt Rich and mighty do; God is the common Father of all, from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Life, and Breath, and all things. Now to deſpiſe thoſe of low degree, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to reflect upon our Creator, and a tacit calling his Juſtice and Wiſdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102510:21"/>queſtion, who, for moſt wiſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſons, beſt known to himſelf, has <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained proſperity and adverſity, and who, as Lord of all, and Father in Common,</hi> may diſpenſe his Bleſſings in number and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, according to his moſt excellent Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And tho' ſome of his dear Children, have ſcanty Portions here, yet they are not leſs in his favour, than they who are bleſt with his more liberal diſpenſations. <hi>Simple Poverty is no Argument of Divine Anger,</hi> but rather of Love (though the unthinking part of the World Conjecture otherwiſe) for the leſs we are intangled with Earthly goods, the more time we have to buſie our ſelves with things which relate to another life; the affections will be more free and prompt, the mind more fixt and intent upon our Spiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all our powers more readily diſpoſed to joyn in holy Duties; we ſhall not be ſo unwilling to part with the world, having ſo ſmall a part of its goods. That which makes this life ſo deſirable is, the having a great ſhare of its comforts: Hence when <hi>Rich Men come to die,</hi> they generally expreſs a great reluctancy, to part with their full Bags, honourable Titles, ſtately Palaces, and all other their Appurtenances. Whereas when <hi>poor Men are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102510:21"/>within a view of death,</hi> have no need to be ſorry that they are bidding a final adieu to this world, becauſe they had <hi>ſo little in it; nor are their precious minutes waſted in bequeathing Legacies, dividing Eſtates, and willing Executors,</hi> (which too often is the unhappy buſineſs of wealthy Men, when they ſhould be dreſſing their Souls, for the embraces of their Redeemer.) <hi>No, no,</hi> all that they have to do is, to renew their love to God, to perfect their Repentance, and recommend their Spirits into the hands of their faithful Creator. But to return, ſince we all deſcend from <hi>one common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> and ſince what we enjoy, whether little or much, is according to his wiſe diſpoſure of things; and ſince the <hi>poor are the ſpecial concern of his providence;</hi> we are highly obliged, as we would not be guilty of diſhonouring God, of reflecting upon that Being, from whom we received our Life and Breath, and calling his Juſtice and Wiſdom into queſtion; to reſpect thoſe that are <hi>fallen into Poverty;</hi> to love them as our Brethren; to do good to them as Objects of our Fathers own recommending.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point, I will ſpeak in the Words of an Eminent Writer; <hi>Our Lord</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is not aſhamed to call the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102510:22"/>leaſt amongſt us his Brother, and his Friend; and ſhall we then diſdain to yield to ſuch an one the regard and treatment ſuitable to ſuch a Ouality? Shall we not honour any Brother of our Lords? Shall we not be civil and kind to any Friend of his? How can we pretend to bear any true Reſpect or Affection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? It is his expreſs Precept that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among us ſhould, in imitation of his moſt Humble and Charitable ſelf, be ready to ſerve the meaneſt; and that we ſhould in honour, prefer one another, and in lowlineſs of mind, eſteem others better than our ſelves,</hi> Rom. 12.10. Phil. 2.3. Theſe are Apoſtolical Rules, extending indifferently to Rich and Poor, which are plainly violated by diſregarding the Poor. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>honour the state of Poverty;</hi> He who was the Son of God, the Heir of Heaven, and the Worſhip of the glorious Hierarchy, was born in a Stable, wrapt in Rags, laid in a Manger; His birth was attended with all the <hi>Inſtances of meanneſs.</hi> When grown to Maturity, his glory was yet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed with <hi>Poverty,</hi> he had not wherewith to lay his head. In a word, his whole life was a full <hi>ſcene of Poverty;</hi> and therefore no diſgrace to be under ordinary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſince Chriſt himſelf condeſcended
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102510:22"/>to be abaſed. In honour therefore to him who has wrought our Redemption, we are obliged to <hi>regard the poor,</hi> whom if we affront, or reproach, or deſpiſe, he tells us, we do the like to him. And ſo much for this laſt Particular, which was, to ſhew how much we are obliged to reſpect thoſe who are <hi>poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to draw ſome uſeful inferences from the whole, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, If Poverty be a state thus ſanctified,</hi> it is no ſmall ſin to caſt calumnious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlections upon it; though the truth of it is, nothing more common. Daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences ſhews us, how that <hi>poor Men are a common reproach,</hi> the ridicule of the Vulgar, the very Objects of the People; <hi>In them ſmall faults are diſcovered, but over-looked, and past by in thoſe who make ſome figure in the world.</hi> But certainly our Religion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to be of another temper, to be Humble, Gentle, and Condeſcending even to the <hi>meanest</hi> of the Brethren; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the <hi>Holy Jeſus as our Pattern and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> to whom we cannot pretend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and affection while we deſpiſe thoſe, whom, while he was in the world, he loved, and generally converſed with, and left a Commandment behind him, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102510:23"/>we ſhould for his ſake do likewiſe. The moſt Puiſſant Princes, the moſt Eminent and Wealthy, but for <hi>one poor Beggar,</hi> had been irrecoverably undone, and loſt for ever: <hi>To Poverty it is we owe all our hopes of Heaven and Happineſs,</hi> ſhall we therefore be ſo diſingenious to aſperſe and ridicule it? <hi>Thou proud and lofty Wretch,</hi> where hadſt thou been if thy Saviour Chriſt had not become <hi>Poor?</hi> Thou hadſt now been roaring among Devils and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fiends. When thou ſeeſt an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Man, the lively Portraicture of the Holy Jeſus, how canſt thou paſs by him, and not call to mind the great things which have been done for thee by him, who was in the form of a Servant, and made himſelf of no Reputation? <hi>Quum pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perem Vidiſti, Chriſtum Vidiſti.</hi> When thou meeteſt with a <hi>poor Man, imagine thou ſeeſt thy Saviour;</hi> and regard him, if not for his own ſake, yet for his, whom thou art infinitely obliged to.</p>
            <p>It is an unhappy thing that Men ſhould be ſunk into ſo vaſt a declenſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as to deride and ſcoff at <hi>Poverty, to which they owe their Redemption</hi> and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That ſame forlorn wretch thou trampleſt upon, has as much <hi>Right to the Kingdom of Heaven as thou;</hi> for him Chriſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102510:23"/>endured Pain, and ſuffered Death, and did all a Saviour could do to Intitle him to Glory and Happineſs! Where then is the diſtinction? What is it that thou valueſt thy ſelf upon? Wherein is he thy Inferior? Becauſe he has not a great Eſtate? Behold, Riches approve not Men unto God; he values no Mans perſon for his Greatneſs, but for his Goodneſs. In the <hi>final Diſquiſition,</hi> Men ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their Actions, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their State and Grandeur; upon which conſideration, a poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> will find as much acceptance, in the day of Judgment, as a rich <hi>Dives;</hi> nay more, the one has received his good things in this Life, the other evil things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one ſhall be comforted, and the other tormented; <hi>not becauſe of his Wealth, but becauſe he did no good with it.</hi> Since God therefore is no reſpecter of Perſons, let us alſo learn to make a leſs diſtinction between our ſelves, to love and reſpect our meaneſt Brethren, and to do to them all the good we can. Again;</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us learn to humble our ſelves with the conſideration of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</hi> Obſerve we our petulant Follies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Perverſeneſs, and treacherous Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities; Nay, our daily wilful Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,

            </q>
            <p>THE former Part of this <hi>Parable</hi> has entertain'd us with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and afflicted Life of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> depainting it in all the <hi>Inſtances of Pity;</hi> he was cloathed with Rags, tormented with painful Sores, and rack'd and griped with Hunger: Such a comfortleſs Condition, enough to make one weary of Life, and wiſh for a <hi>ſudden Exit!</hi> and the more when Succour is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd. From this poor wretch, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts were with-held, not ſo much as <hi>the crumbs allowed him which fell from the Rich Man's Table: It encourages, and bears a Man up, under languiſhing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when he is careſs'd with pity, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102510:25"/>gets ſome relief, tho' but the fragments of a Meal.</hi> But ſuch was the unfortunate Fate of poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his importunate cries, ghaſtly looks, ſhatter'd cloaths, and ulcerated fleſh, none gave unto, nor condol'd with him; hungry and thirſty, his Soul fainted in him; no Friends, nor wherewithal to ſupport him in this his diſtreſſed condition. But tho' he was thus inhumanely dealt with, we read not that he <hi>reflected upon Providence, or charg'd God fooliſhly,</hi> but humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him who diſpoſeth all things, patiently waiting for a happy change, either a ſufficient competency while he lived, or a <hi>tranſlation</hi> out of this World into a better.</p>
            <p>My Text therefore preſents us with a ſudden, but happy alteration of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It came to paſs that the Beggar died:</hi> An end of all his wants, ſorrows, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts. God has ever a gracious regard to the lamentable groans, and afflicted ſtate of his poor Servants; and tho' he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem long ere he anſwers their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and expectation, yet in a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitting his moſt excellent Wiſdom, he graciouſly crowns them with their hearts deſire. <hi>Lazarus not only died, but was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102510:25"/>by Angels into Abrahams boſom:</hi> His Soul, not his Body; probably that was expoſed to ravenous Beaſts, or Fowls, or elſe to <hi>innumerable Vermine in the Grave,</hi> if any were ſo charitably diſpos'd to bury it, tho' reaſon enough there is to believe the contrary: For while he lived, he could not get ſuſtenance, his hunger, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſores, no body regarded, much leſs his <hi>dead Body, to give it a decent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But no matter, his Soul was return'd to him that gave it; and his Body too, tho' never ſo much mangled, and diſpers'd into never ſo many Atoms, ſhall be compacted together, made vivid and formable, at the command of the great Creator.</p>
            <p>Now the Text contains two Parts: The</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>is, A Deſcription of the Death of</hi> Lazarus: <hi>And it came to paſs that the Beggar died.</hi> The</p>
            <p>Second, <hi>Gives an account of the condition and state of his Soul: And was carried by Angels into Abrahams boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence theſe two great Points are proved:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Soul is capable of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence ſeparated from the Body.</hi> Let that fond conjecture then of thoſe be condemn'd, who imagine that the Soul, together with the Body, declineth in the Earth.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:102510:26"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Souls of the Faithful, when they depart from their Bodies, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paſs into a fixed ſtate of Bleſſedneſs.</hi> But that which I ſhall at this time treat on, will be the <hi>Death of Lazarus;</hi> and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcanting upon this, I ſhall,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, Conſider what were the immediate Cauſes of his Death.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What kind of treatment he met with while languiſhing. And then,</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What became of his Body after Death.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I am to conſider <hi>what were the immediate Cauſes of</hi> Lazarus'<hi>s Death:</hi> And here, if we reflect upon his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances while living, we may ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He wanted the Staff of Life, namely, Bread: He <hi>deſired to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the Rich Man's Table,</hi> but was uncharitably refus'd them. Hunger is a ſharp Thorn, it dries up the Blood, it decays thoſe rarer Ornaments of Nature, Beauty, and a ſanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; it preys upon the Spirits, and makes them faint and droop. In a word, Hunger deſtroys the Marrow, weakens the Bones, and puts the whole frame of Nature into a grand diſorder. And here the griping pains, the gnawings this poor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102510:26"/>wretch endur'd, the lamentable ſighs and groans he fetch'd, the doleful complaints he made, (what a <hi>gbaſtly countenance be had?</hi>) reduc'd to ſuch a degree of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he could not ſtand, for he <hi>lay at the Rich Man's Gates.</hi> Such a condition as this, doubtleſs, makes Life burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and Death more eligible. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by conſtant Experience, that ſome who are of cholerick and furious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>vent themſelves in wiſhes for a ſpeedy Exit,</hi> when ſome leſs dangerous accidents befal them; how much more therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable is it, to live, and (if I may ſo ſay) <hi>ſtand and ſee ones ſelf die;</hi> as properly ſpeaking, they do, who ſuffer Hunger, and have not intermiſſions of a reaſonable ſatiety? This was the ill fortune of <hi>poor Lazarus;</hi> he was reduced to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that he would have been <hi>glad of the crumbs, the portiuncula, the leaſt and worſt fragments, which dropp'd under the Rich Man's Table.</hi> It is to be preſum'd, that there are ſcarce any, or at leaſt very few, who are in ſuch extremity; but doubtleſs, this was one cauſe which haſten'd <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s <hi>Death,</hi> namely, Hunger: For ſince nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upholdeth Nature, reviving the Blood, recruiting the Spirits, feeding the Bones and Marrow, whereby, Life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102510:27"/>the want of this muſt ſoon decay, and overthrow the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Poor</hi> Lazarus! <hi>So hungry, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to feed thee! Not one Morſel from a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Table! If the Maſter of the Houſe was ſo ſeer'd and impenetrable, as to deny thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable requeſt, ſurely the Servants might have accommodated thee with ſome of their Remains: No! What, ſuffer thee to periſh for want of that which themſelves would not eat! O unheard of Cruelty! O monſtrous Barbarity!</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another cauſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Death, was thoſe Ulcers and putrifying Sores which had invaded and corrupted his fleſh: <hi>He was laid at the rich mans gate, full of ſores.</hi> As he had no Friend to ſuſtain his Hunger, neither was there any found to bind up his Wounds: Theſe, for want of application, infected the whole Maſs of Blood, ſeized his Vitals, and haſten'd the deſtruction of Nature. <hi>O miſerable Object! Starv'd with Hunger, and ſull of Sores too: Without Friend, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pity! Evil upon Evil!</hi> The <hi>Holy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> could not but cure the Leper, when he ſaw him full of Sores. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> could not, but out of Humanity, teach <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> to waſh himſelf in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might be whole; but this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102510:27"/>
               <hi>Rich Man would not help</hi> Lazarus, <hi>but left him to languiſh and die.</hi> Doubtleſs it was a great addition of his miſery, to be full of Blotches and running Ulcers; for as his Hunger tormented and gnaw'd upon his inwards, ſo his Sores grieved and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fleſh; both the one and the other, contriving to ſtorm his Soul out of the Out-works of Nature. But thus much for the firſt thing; which was, To conſider what were the <hi>proper Cauſes of</hi> Lazarus'<hi>s Death:</hi> And from hence I proceed in the ſecond place; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To conſider <hi>what kind of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Lazarus <hi>met withal, while he was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, or dying.</hi> We read of no Friends that came either to viſit, or to comfort him with Medicaments. <hi>Thus, generally, the poor Servants of God are treated, when retain'd by a Fit of Sickneſs, and drawing near to a period;</hi> many of them periſh for want of reaſonable applications: None, or very few, vouchſafe them an hours conſolation; they groan, they ſigh, they pant, and die without pity. Such uſage as this <hi>Lazarus met withal, in his dying hours:</hi> Rich Men are ſupplied with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, furniſh'd with Potions; and when dying, <hi>their Friends ſtand ſhrieking about the Bed, and fill the Room with dolorous ſounds:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102510:28"/>They grieve for their approaching loſs, and enhance their ſorrows with the repetition of former benefits;</hi> if it were poſſible they would conquer Death, and reſcue their departing Friends out of his clutches. But <hi>poor Lazarus,</hi> as he had no inward applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo no outward comforts; <hi>not a Bed to lie upon, the Earth was his Pillow, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was his Covering, the Rich Man's Dogs were his Viſitants;</hi> not one of his Servants would vouchſafe him a reviving Draught, or any thing that was comfortable, but there he lay, ſcreeching with anguiſh, ſighing and groaning, waiting till Death would ſtrike, and releaſe him from his great wants, and heavy conflicts. Now his Throat growing dry with crying, his Heart fainting for want of comfort, his Tongue cleaving to the Roof of his Mouth, being worn out with Faſtings and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>he gave a groan, and periſhed at this wretches Gate. Was ever heart ſo hard!</hi> Could it be imagined, that a rational Creature could be guilty of ſuch Cruelty! and eſpecially towards one of his Fellow-Creatures! It was inhumane in thee, <hi>O Dives,</hi> to have no compaſſion upon poor <hi>Lazarus;</hi> but it argues much more a ſear'd Nature, to ſuffer him to faint and die at thy very Door, for want of a few frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102510:28"/>of Bread! What was his requeſt to thee? He ask'd not for dainty food, ſuch which was thy daily Entertainment, but only for thoſe Scraps, which neither <hi>thy Servants nor Dogs would eat,</hi> to ſave his Life: And was it ſuch a matter, to have granted him this his ſo reaſonable deſire? Will it not be a blemiſh on thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that thou ſhouldſt ſuffer a Soul to periſh with hunger, when thou hadſt enough, and abundantly to ſpare? Couldſt thou ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> trembling and quaking with cold, having only ſhatter'd Rags about him, and not cover his nakedneſs, when thou hadſt <hi>ſtore of Caſt-off Garments?</hi> Were his wounds ſo deep and gaping upon thee, and neither thou, nor thy Servants, by thy order, pour Oil into them? If the Stones could ſpeak, they would cry, fie on thee: If thy Dogs could utter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would charge thee with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs: If <hi>Lazarus</hi> were alive, his Sores would guſh out afreſh in thy Face, and ſound in thine Ears, that thou art guilty of his Blood. <hi>Behold, the Sentence is gone forth againſt thee; the blood of</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>like the blood of</hi> Abel, <hi>cries aloud, Let thy days be few, and let another take thine Office; Let thy Children be Fatherleſs, and thy Wife a Widow; Let thy Children be Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102510:29"/>and beg their Bread; let them ſeek it alſo out of deſolate places. Let the Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner conſume all that thou haſt, and let the Stranger ſpoil thy labour: Let there be no Man to pity thee, nor to have compaſſion on thy Fatherleſs Children: Let thy Memorial be clean forgotten, and in the next Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion let thy Name be quite blotted out. Let him be unſucceſsful in every thing he taketh in hand; let him be Accurs'd when he goeth out, and when he cometh in. Let the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor abandon him, the Heavens frown upon him, and the Angels reject him; let him be a woful Example to the World. O Earth! open upon him, Hell receive him, Spirits tear him, Devils torment him. Let no Mercy be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed towards him, who ſhut up his bowels of compaſſion againſt his diſtreſſed and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brother.</hi> The ſorrowful ſighing of the Poor ſhall not always be forgotten, God will avenge their injuries, if not in this Life, yet in that which is to come. But thus much for the ſecond thing, which was to conſider <hi>what uſage poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>met with while he lay languiſhing,</hi> while he was haſtening to a period. I am now to go on in the third place;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To enquire what became of his dead Body.</hi> And here we cannot ſuppoſe that his Body had any <hi>decent Interment;</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:102510:29"/>becauſe, while living, it had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſuſtain it. He was Brow-beaten, ſcoff'd at, rejected, <hi>a Companion for Dogs,</hi> the very abject of the People; thoſe that paſs'd by him, upbraided his Poverty, turn'd their Heads away from the ſtench of his Sores, and ſtopp'd their Ears to his woful Complaints. Now if his hungry Stomach, ulcerous Body, and fainting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and diſmal Out cries, would not move to pity, we may reaſonably conjecture <hi>that his dead Body was not taken care of.</hi> That it might not infect with ſtrong and loathſome ſmells, it may be it was <hi>cramm'd into ſome narrow hole in the Earth,</hi> or thrown into ſome rapid River or other. <hi>No Bell to proclaim his Death, no Knell to uſher him to the Grave, no Friends to accompany his Corps, which are the uſual methods of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Thus poor Men ſlip ſilently into the Earth, and have none to mourn over them, but their diſtreſſed Widows and Orphans, who miſs thoſe little Comforts they were the Authors of;</hi> but yet poor Mens Souls are as precious in the ſight of God as rich Mens. The World diſtinguiſhes Men by their Rank and Quality, but God by their Goodneſs; and how mean ſoever his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may be in this Life, yet they ſhall be hereafter Kings and Prieſts, and reign
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102510:30"/>with God for ever. It matters not then, <hi>O Chriſtian, tho' thou art poor and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> thou art not to live here always; the time is coming, when all things will be ſet to rights, when thou ſhalt have amends made thee for thy ſcanty Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe Indignities offer'd thee for thy Poverty; then every Man ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to his Works. A <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a <hi>Belteſhazzar,</hi> a lofty <hi>Felix,</hi> and an ambitious <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>other Grandees of the World,</hi> ſhall be no more reſpected than thou: <hi>For God is no reſpecter of perſons. It is no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy Body be honourably buried or no, if thy Soul be but vertuous, and found in the ways of holineſs;</hi> then both ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly re-united, and live together in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi> for ever. <hi>Poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>lived miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, died ſo,</hi> and his Body probably, thrown into ſome Pit or other; but yet <hi>his Soul was carried by the Angels into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams boſom.</hi> And thus much for the death of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> I now proceed to make ſome ſpecial Uſe of what has been ſaid, and then conclude. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>From hence we may learn, that it is very often the lot of God's dear Children to ſuffer Affliction in this Life.</hi> Not that he delights in the Miſeries of his People, but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102510:30"/>becauſe he would fit them for himſelf; draw their Affections from things here below, let them ſee the vanity and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Worldly ſatisfactions, and put their confidence in him as a ſure Refuge in time of trouble. Such are the wiſe and holy ends of God towards his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Job, a juſt Man, and one that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and eſchewed evil,</hi> was wofully puniſhed, his Children ſuddenly ſlain, his Plenty turned into Scarcity, his Body afflicted with Swellings and Carbuncles, his Friends became his Enemies, his Wife, in the midſt of ſufferings, tempting him; who would but conclude that this was a Judgment upon him, for ſome great ſin or other? And yet is it left upon Record, that <hi>this change of things was only to try him,</hi> who yet retaining his Integrity; was bleſt with much more than ever he had. S. <hi>James</hi> 1.2. ſays, <hi>Count it all joy, when ye fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations.</hi> As if he had expreſs'd himſelf thus: Be not diſheartned and caſt down if Calamities beſiege you, provided they be not of your own ſeeking, but by God's Providence; for he has no other end upon you, but to make you yet better, and to fit you more exactly for his heavenly Kingdom. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>makes affliction a ſpecial mark of God's love.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102510:31"/>Whom he loves, he rebukes, and chaſtens every Son whom he receives.</hi> Then, <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> bear up under thy ſufferings: Haſt thou but a ſcanty Portion, hardly enough to keep thee alive? Be content, Heaven will be thine; and tho' it may ſeem long ere thou be in poſſeſſion of it, yet it will infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely make thee amends when thou comeſt there. Art thou friendleſs? Doſt thou ſuffer Reproach, Calumnies? Do Men deſpiſe thee? Does the World deny thee Peace? Haſt thou none that will take thy part? Sink not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this calamity, for <hi>God is thy Friend,</hi> he hears thy Sighs and Groans, records thy Prayers, and bottles up thy Tears, and will abundantly recompence thee when thou <hi>comeſt into his Kingdom.</hi> Put thy truſt in him, keep covenant with Chriſt, and get an intereſt in him, and <hi>fear not what Man can do unto thee.</hi> It was this which encouraged the Martyrs under their Sufferings, and made them even <hi>rejoice in the midſt of their bitter conflicts;</hi> they made their Calling and Election ſure; all was well between God and their Spirits, and therefore fainted not at the thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to him, tho' by the moſt violent and cruel death. It is recorded of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that when he was condemned by that imperious Tyrant <hi>Trajan,</hi> to be torn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102510:31"/>by wild Beaſts, he replied, <hi>I am not afraid to go out of the World this way, nor at the ſuddenneſs of my departure; for I care not how ſoon, nor by what means, I haſten to my dear Redeemer, whom I love more than Life, for that I can freely part with all for his ſake, who did ſo much for me; he did groan, and ſigh, ſweat, bleed, and die for me, and therefore I can never forget him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> we <hi>learn to be pitiful and compaſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that are Poor. Lazarus</hi> died with hunger. Had his Neceſſities been ſupplied, he might have lived longer; but wanting Nouriſhment, he died. What a ſad Conſideration is it, to ſend the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty away empty, when Men have to ſpare? This argues an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mind towards God, and an inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our own Demerits. If God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſhould deal with us proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to our deſerts, Hell would become our Lot; but he deals not with us after our Sins, nor rewards us according to our Iniquities; he overlooks our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Weakneſſes, paſſes by our many wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miſcarriages, forgives the Affronts we offer to his Divine Majeſty, and crowns us with his Goodneſs; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Hand is always heaping Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102510:32"/>upon us, his Mercy triumphs over Judgment. Now the meer Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, methinks, is enough to make Men of <hi>flexible, condeſcending Humours,</hi> of compaſſionate, charitable Diſpoſitions, and oblige them to be as forward to give, as the Poor is to ask them; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Abilities. What a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing is it, when a poor Man, almoſt famiſhed, his Face wan, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ghaſtly, his Spirits fainting, and his Tongue cleaving to the roof of his Mouth, <hi>and begs for God's ſake, for Chriſt Jeſus ſake, to ſatisfie his craving Stomach, and thirſly Soul,</hi> or elſe he muſt periſh, to ſend him away empty as he came! Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this pining Wretch ſhould drop, and die at thy Door, upon a denial; tho' this be not <hi>Murder in the ſenſe of ours, yet it is in the judgment of God's Laws,</hi> and his Blood thou muſt anſwer for; and, O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account in the Day of Inquiſition! Chriſt, who is the <hi>ordained Judge,</hi> has threatned to revenge the Indignities of his poor Servants, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; for I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and ye gave me no drink; I was naked, and ye cloathed me not; I was a ſtranger,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102510:32"/>and ye took me not in; I was ſick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> Then will the uncharitable anſwer, and ſay, <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or a thirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi> Then ſhall he anſwer them, <hi>In as much as ye did it not unto one of the leaſt of theſe my poer ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ye did it not to me; and in denying of them, ye deny'd me, and their cauſe I will eſpouſe; and therefore go ye carſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the <hi>death of</hi> Lazarus <hi>we learn to be content with our Condition,</hi> tho' never ſo mean; and to keep our ſelves in the Exerciſe of Religion, tho' we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this Worlds goods. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> tho' he was Hungry and Thirſty, his Soul fainted in him; tho' he was Naked and full of Sores; yet he murmured not, but committed himſelf to God, <hi>to whom his Soul was carried by the Angels, as ſoon as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Body. It is excellent to be Poor and Virtuous; for it argues the ſtrongeſt Faith, the beſt Hope, and the beſt Affections,</hi> becauſe there are not thoſe outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Goodneſs in Adverſity, as Proſperity. Poverty is look'd upon as a kind of Judgment, as if God hates the Perſon, and therefore makes him an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102510:33"/>of Scorn and Infamy; ſo that he is apt to be diſcouraged, and can do nothing elſe but bewail, and lament his unhappy circumſtances, ſit drooping and pauſing on his low condition. But however, the Scripture has well inform'd us, that God Almighty means no ill towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that when he changes things, and removes Proſperity from the Door, it is only to try them, how they will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage themſelves upon an alteration, what kind of nature they will appear to have, whether they will make application to him, and carry themſelves in all Duty and Allegiance towards him. And ſince ſuch is God's Wiſe deſign, it is but very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that we ſhould be <hi>as Good and Vertuous when poor, as well as when rich;</hi> eſpecially, conſidering that we deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the Hands of God, nothing but Fury and everlaſting Damnation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the advantage of Piety; Is a Man poor and low in the World? it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and ſweeten even that State: It keepeth <hi>his Spirits up above dejection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, and diſconſolateneſs; it frees him from all grievous ſolicitude vnd anxiety,</hi> ſhewing him, that altho' he ſeemeth to have little, yet he may be aſſured to want nothing, he having a certain Succour,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102510:33"/>and never-failing ſupply from God's good Providence; that notwithſtanding the preſent ſtraightneſs of his condition, or ſcantineſs of outward things, he has <hi>a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to goods infinitely more precious, and more conſiderable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude,</hi> Let it be our main imploy to improve our Judgments and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in things Spiritual, that we may have <hi>right notions of God,</hi> ſuch as become the perfections of his Nature, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Goodneſs; that in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtate and condition we are, we may glorifie his Name. And thus, when we have <hi>conquer'd our ſelves,</hi> and brought our Minds to a ſettlement in the ways of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we ſhall reſign our Concernments with more freedom to God's wiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and be ſubmiſſive to his Laws, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our condition be.</p>
            <p>May God aſſiſt us, by the influences of his Grace and <hi>bleſſed Spirit,</hi> ſo to order and govern our Natures, that we may love him freely, <hi>believe in him ſtedfaſtly,</hi> and ſerve him faithfully to our lives end. And this for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, to whom with the Father, and ever bleſſed Spirit, <hi>be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all Honour, Praiſe, Thanksgiving and Obedience, now, henceforth, and for ever more.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>HAving in my laſt Diſcourſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Death of</hi> Lazarus, <hi>and particularly conſidered what were the immediate cauſes of his death: the manner and circumſtance of his dying, and how his dead body was probably diſpoſed of:</hi> My Text now leads me to conſider <hi>the ſtate and condition of his Soul;</hi> after ſeparation from the Body, <hi>It was carried by the Angels into Abrahams boſom.</hi> Many differ in their ſentiments about this Expreſſion, and have conceived Witty and Learned Notions of it, but yet ſeem to agree in this, that by <hi>Abrahams boſom is meant Heaven;</hi> and the Reaſon of this phraſe is, <hi>Abraham is ſtiled, The Father of the Faithful,</hi> and while he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102510:34"/>lived, a very Hoſpitable perſon; to him was the <hi>Soul of Lazarus</hi> convey'd, as a Sanctuary of Reſt and Peace; the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his patience, during his great want, and heavy conflicts. Some urge it as a Metaphor from <hi>Parents,</hi> who imboſom and hug their Children, when tired by running to and fro, or have met with ſome hurtful miſchance, and come weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting themſelves. A very adapt Parallel: The Soul of <hi>poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>was grieved</hi> and wearied with Faſtings and Miſeries; perplexed and overwhelm'd with ſorrows for the cruel treatment he met with in the world; it was therefore <hi>conducted by the Heavenly Courtiers into</hi> Abraham's <hi>boſom,</hi> to be ſuccour'd and made amends for paſt indignities. <hi>He was carried by the Angels:</hi> As if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended who ſhould uſher it into Paradiſe. Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> thou recounteſt with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; the difficulties thou haſt rubb'd through, the afflictions thou haſt endured, the ſhame, pain, and ignominy thou haſt undergone for Chriſts ſake; Now thou art made acquainted with the <hi>Arcana Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii, the ſecrets of the other happy World,</hi> and rejoyceſt with <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> Nothing ſhall interrupt thy peace, nor call thee off from thy enjoyments, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102510:35"/>there thou ſhalt ſwim in rapturous pleaſures for evermore. <hi>This may ſerve to prevent thoſe who are in ſorrow, trouble, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adverſity, from reflecting upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, as if he unequally diſtributed his Mercies.</hi> In this life, it matters not whether his Servants be accommodated with ſublunary affluences, or no, ſince he has prepared <hi>a wide and capacious Heaven,</hi> to receive and repleniſh them; wherein are all the <hi>inſtances of Joy,</hi> all the ingredients of felicity, and nothing elſe to the contrary; all that can <hi>careſs our powers, all that can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh our hearts, all that is good, lovely &amp; deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> is there to be compendiouſly enjoyed. But to traverſe the Text, <hi>The Soul of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus <hi>was carried by the Angels into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſom, or Heaven;</hi> Which words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That the Angels are imploy'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Souls of true Believers into a fixed ſtate of bleſſedneſs:</hi> And to prove this, (granting that there are ſuch Beings as Angels, becauſe the Scriptures often ſpeak of them, I ſhall, <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, Undertake to ſhew their <hi>Offices,</hi> as relating to God's faithful Children in this life. <hi>Secondly, The great love and kindneſs they have for mankind.</hi>

               </gap>, miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation. <hi>The word (Angel) ſignifies an Ambaſſador,</hi> which is ſent upon another's Errand; and in Scripture ſenſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainedly taken for <hi>a ſelect, divine ſort of Emiſſaries, Spiritual Beings, created, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned, and employed by, and under God.</hi> Now firſt, it is part of the Angels Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon any urgency, to reveal God's mind and will, and to bring Embaſſies from him to us, for our inſtruction and good. Thus, while <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſitting at the Tent-door, in the <hi>Plains of Mamre,</hi> he beheld <hi>three Men,</hi> which were <hi>three Angels,</hi> who came to inform him that a Son ſhould ſhortly be born unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10. Likewiſe, while <hi>Lot</hi> was ſitting in the Gate of <hi>Sodom, two Angels ſalute him,</hi> and deliver their Meſſage, ſaying, <hi>Haſten thou, and thine, out of this City, for the Lord has commiſſioned us to deſtroy it, becauſe of the wickedneſs of the people that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Gen.</hi> 19.12, 13. Again, when <hi>Balaam</hi> the Prophet was journying upon an ill Errand, <hi>an Angel</hi> from the Lord interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, cautioning him to do according as God had commanded him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 35. Thoſe Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> were from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102510:36"/>an <hi>Angel,</hi> and being at a loſs about their ſignificancy and meaning, <hi>Gabriel the Arch-Angel,</hi> was diſpatched to inform his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to give him light into thoſe dark and abſtruſe Myſteries, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.16. and 9.22, 23. And in the Goſpel, we read of an <hi>Angel,</hi> who careſſed <hi>Zecharias</hi> with the happy news of a Son, who ſhould be the Harbinger and Fore-runner of the Meſſias: <hi>That an Angel addreſſed the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>acquainting her that ſhe was appointed by God to conceive and bear that Meſſias.</hi> And that <hi>Angels</hi> ſurpriz'd the drowſie Shepherds in the Field by night, with the news of the Birth of the Child Jeſus. That <hi>an Angel appeared three times to</hi> Joſeph; Firſt, to encourage him to take and own <hi>Mary</hi> his Eſpouſed Wife; then to haſten him with <hi>the young Child, and Mother, into</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fury and ſavageneſs of</hi> Herod; and then, laſtly to return again, when the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was abated. When the forgetful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came to ſeek their Crucified Saviour in the Sepulchre, <hi>the Angels reminded them that he was riſen from the dead,</hi> according as he had told them when he was yet alive. I might inſert many more Inſtances of this kind, that the <hi>Angels are God's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,</hi> upon an occaſion, ſent to reveal
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102510:36"/>his will, for our inſtruction and good. But concerning the <hi>Doctrinal Miniſtry of Angels,</hi> we are not now to expect ſuch extraordinary Revelations, becauſe God hath appointed other Emiſſaries for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his mind to the World. He hath ſent his Son, cloathed with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who has given us a Specimen of his Will; and, in his abſence, ſubſtituted his Apoſtles to propagate the Goſpel, enabling them to continue a Succeſſion of Miniſters, to handle and preach the Word, for the ſaving of Souls, as St. <hi>Paul ſpeaks,</hi> Eph 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of the Faith, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Viſible Miniſters we are now to hearken to, in the <hi>room of Angels,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace their Doctrine, as the means whereby we may be ſaved To theſe Ambaſſadors <hi>the Angels themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men under the Goſpel. An Angel</hi> calls <hi>Philip</hi> towards the South, on purpoſe to meet the Eunuch, that he might preach Jeſus to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.26. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102510:37"/>his Devotion, an <hi>Angel</hi> careſſes him with this Salutation, <hi>Thy prayers are come up for a memorial before God;</hi> but bids him ſend to <hi>Joppa</hi> for one <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſter, who would inſtruct him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what he ought to do, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. So bufie are theſe <hi>Heavenly Spirits</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the knowledge of thoſe bleſſed Myſteries, which themſelves look into with wonder and amazement. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a part of the Angels Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to be our Guardians,</hi> to fence us from eminent Evils, to ſhelter us from Dangers, and to direct us in ways of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril and Uncertainty. Thus the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> encourages God's faithful Servants to perſevere in Holineſs, by telling them, <hi>That the Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 34.7. And there ſhall no evil befal thee, for, <hi>he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways; they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone,</hi> Pſal. 91.10, 11, 12. Doubtleſs theſe Celeſtial Spirits do us many good Offices, they contrive our ſafety, and advance our happineſs, and promote our welfare, tho' we are not privy to their tranſactions. As before I mentioned, our Saviour was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the furious rage, and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102510:37"/>malice of <hi>Herod,</hi> by an <hi>Angel's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Joſeph <hi>to flee into</hi> Egypt. Hiſtory furniſhes us with many Inſtances of this kind, how ſome, whoſe lives have been ſecretly ſought for, and the Emiſſaries of death have been coming forward <hi>incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to embrue their hands in blood, have been reſcued from thoſe Aſſaſſines, by the <hi>timely warnings of an Angel;</hi> others, who have ſimply attempted their own Danger, and have juſt brought themſelves to the brink of deſtruction, have been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerv'd by the <hi>opportune inſinuation of an Angel; Cave, beware.</hi> Again, others who have been ſurpriz'd out of their ſleep, and caution'd to haſten with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies out of the Towns wherein they have lived, for that they would be ſuddenly viſited with a ſweeping Plague, and ſo it happen'd a little time after their removal. <hi>Thus ſollicitous, by Divine appointment, are theſe heavenly Spirits, for the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Mankind.</hi> But again,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is part of the Angels Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, not only to defend from danger, and to ſcreen from approaching evils; but to comfort the diſconſolate, to help in time of need, and to bring ſupplies in times of ſcarcity. When <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet was threatned by <hi>Jezebel</hi> with death, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102510:38"/>the chief of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Followers, he fled to <hi>Beer-Sheba;</hi> and leaving his Servant there, <hi>he went a days Journey into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and being overwhelm'd with ſorrow, he ſate him down under a Juniper-Tree, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning rather to die, than to live, and fell aſleep; in the interim an Angel touched him, and ſaid, Ariſe and eat:</hi> And <hi>be looked, and behold there was a Cake baken on the Coals, and a cruſe of Water at his head: And he did eat, and drink, and laid him down again. And the Angel of the Lord came again the ſecond time, and touched him, and ſaid, Ariſe and eat, becauſe the Journey is too great for thee: And he aroſe, and did eat, and drink, and went in the ſtrengeh of that meat forty days, and forty nights, unto</hi> Horeb <hi>the Mount of God,</hi> 1 Kings 19.5, 6, 7, 8. When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet cryed out, upon ſight of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Wo is me! for I am unclean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips;</hi> there flew one of the Seraphims unto him, having a live Coal in his hand, which he had taken with the Tongs from off the Altar, and he laid it upon his Mouth, and ſaid, <hi>Lo this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged,</hi> Iſa. 6.5, 6.7. When our deareſt Lord was ſtrugling in a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102510:38"/>mighty Agony, that he <hi>ſweat as it were great drops of blood, when the bitter cup was preſented to him, of which he was to drink, and which he prayed, if poſſible, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him; in the midſt of his conflicts the Angels, his Attendants, came and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.</hi> When in the Wilderneſs, ſet on, and tempted by the Devil, thoſe Celeſtical Spirits came and Miniſtred unto him. When <hi>Lot</hi> was in danger of being torn apieces by ſome of the vicious Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, <hi>two Angels</hi> haled him into his Houſe from their fury, and ſtruck thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed him with blindneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.10, 11. <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech, and Abednego,</hi> thoſe true Servants of the moſt High God, being condemned by that Tyrant <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> to be ſcorched to death in a Furnace ſeven times hotter than ordinary, they were thrown in, bound hand and foot; but behold an <hi>Angel</hi> indemniſied them, they were not ſinged, neither had the flames any power on them. <hi>Did we not,</hi> ſays <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 3.24, 25. <hi>caſt three men bound into the fiery furnace? Lo, I ſee four men looſe, walking in the midſt of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi> was doom'd to the Lions Den, in order to be devoured by them;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102510:39"/>an <hi>Angel,</hi> by an irreſiſtible power, reſtrains the appetites of thoſe voracious Beaſts, that he dwelt in ſafety in the midſt of danger. <hi>My God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>has ſent his Angel, and hath ſhut the Lions Mouths, that they have not hurt me; for as much as before him Innocncy was found in me; and alſo before thee, O King, have I done no hurt,</hi> Dan. 6.22. To name no more; When <hi>Peter</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by <hi>Herod,</hi> and a ſtrong watch ordered to keep him ſafe; Behold! an <hi>Angel</hi> came to him, and unlooſed his Chains, burſt open the Priſon-door, led him through the Wards, and coming to the main Iron Gate, that opened of its own accord. This miraculous deliverance did ſo amaze <hi>Peter,</hi> that he could ſcarce believe the truth of it, till coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he humbly accknowledged, ſaying, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.11. <hi>Now I know of a ſurety, that the Lord has ſent his Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of</hi> Herod, <hi>and from all the expectation of the People of the Jews.</hi> Thus theſe Celeſtial Spirits encamp round about them that fear the Lord. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am to conſider the great love theſe <hi>Heavenly Courtiers</hi> bear to Mankind. And here, doubtleſs their affection is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely great: For when the Son of God deſcended from above, and Ecclipſed his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102510:39"/>glory with humane Nature, to work the Redemption of man, theſe <hi>Celeſtial Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors gathered together, expreſſing their joy for the Reſtauration of lapſed Mortals, by a general ſhout; and then joyning in a Chorus, Sang, Glory be to God on High, and on Earth Peace, good will towards men,</hi> Luke 2.14. They could not but celebrate this ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious act of Condeſcenſion, and loudly eccho it in the Shepherds ears. They ſeemed, as it were, tranſported that they had a meſſage of this kind, to deliver to undone Mortals, who were groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own burden. When a ſtuborn ſinner returns from the errour of his ways, bethinks himſelf, alters his mind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new Creature; theſe <hi>Heavenly Spirits are all in a Rapture, and Exſtacy;</hi> they break out into loud acclamations of joy, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. <hi>There is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God, over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth.</hi> And the Reaſons of this are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe their employment for God is encreaſed. They are Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to Miniſter for thoſe who ſhall <hi>be heirs of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe every <hi>converted ſinner adds to their Communion.</hi> In ſome reſpects, even now, <hi>Angels are a Saint's Familiar,</hi> they have a ſpecial charge over them, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102510:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>pitch their Tents round about, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto them; but that which enhances their gladneſs, they ſhall enjoy an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Converſation with them, <hi>Sing and praiſe the Lamb that ſits upon the Throne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> Behold the beauty, meditae upon the glorious perfections of God, and be <hi>ſwallowed up in holy wonder.</hi> This it is which enjoins the Angels to take ſuch care of the Saints in this life, defending them from extraordinary miſchiefs, guarding them from the Power and Malice of the Devil, directing them in ways of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and peril, <hi>watching over them by night, and conducting them by day;</hi> namely, that their Communion may be improved, their Joys fulfilled, in an everlaſting har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; mutual concord. And now, if God has thus. Commiſſioned his <hi>Angels</hi> to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to his Saints, to defend and keep them, to guard and ſhield them from dangers and miſchiefs; and if theſe <hi>glorious Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bear ſo great a love to men,</hi> as has been plainly proved; doubtleſs they <hi>are very ready to receive, and carry the Souls of good men into Heaven.</hi> One of the Fathers calls the Angels <hi>(Evocatores animarum)</hi> The callers forth of Souls, and ſuch as ſhew them <hi>(paraturam diverſorii)</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of thoſe Manſions they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102510:40"/>to. Hence we obſerve, <hi>When good men are dying, they are often in ſilent rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and expreſs a kind of impatience, till they are diſſolved.</hi> And why? becauſe they ſpiritually ſee what they cannot utter, as did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was <hi>wrapt up into the third Heaven.</hi> There is a kind of a <hi>draught preſented to them, by their Guardian Angels, of thoſe tranſcendant joys they are almoſt ready to enter in poſſeſſion of;</hi> and therefore long, and pine, till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into that place of Unſpeakable Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Theſe Heavenly Spirits ſuccour and ſupport them under their <hi>pain and ſickneſs;</hi> and when their Souls are ſtormed out of their Bodies, they encompaſs and embrace them, <hi>ſoaring through the Regions of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into Heaven.</hi> As my Text ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lazarus, that he was ſafely carried by the Angels into</hi> Abraham's <hi>boſom.</hi> And thus much for the Propoſition I raiſed from the words of the Text, namely, <hi>That the Angels are employed to convey the Soul, of true Believers, as ſoon as ſeparated from their Bodies, into a fixed ſtate of bleſſedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to draw ſome practical Inferences from the whole, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. And here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, We cannot but admire at Gods ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love to men, that he ſhould create ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102510:41"/>to be our Guardians, to help and ſuccout us in the time of our Pilgrimage here.</hi> What is Man, that God ſhould be ſo mindful of him? or the Son of Man that he ſhould ſo regard him? What tongue can be ſilent, upon a ſerious thoughtfulneſs of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God conferreth upon Man? Let us then break out with St. <hi>Bernard, Lord, what is Man, that thou thinkest thus on him?</hi> Thou ſendeſt to him thine only begotten Son; thou ſendeſt into him thy Holy Spirit; thou promiſeſt him the light of thy Countenance; and that nothing in the <hi>Heavenly Region</hi> might be un-imployed in follicitude for him; thou ſendeſt forth alſo thoſe <hi>bleſſed Spirits, the Angels, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to us</hi> And with another of the Ancients, who ſtudiouſly contemplating this Subject, and reflecting upon his own unworthineſs thus uttered himſelf, <hi>When I remember theſe things, O Lord I confeſs before thee, and praiſe thee for thy great benefits, wherewith thou haſt honoured us. Thou haſt given us all things under Heaven, and yet countedſt that but a ſmall proviſion, unleſs thou hadſt alſo given us the things above, even thoſe Angels of thine, as Miniſtring Spirits unto us? What is man that thou thus reſpecteſt him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conſideration, that the Angels are about us, ſhould <hi>fill us with a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102510:41"/>reverential awe and dread, and oblige us to be circumſpect and innocent in our tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw a Ladder, reaching from Earth to Heaven, and the <hi>Angels</hi> of God aſcending and deſcending upon it, he ſaid, How dreadful is this place! his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was ſtruck with fear. And certainly, if we confidered that theſe <hi>Heavenly Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> were attending us, curiouſly obſerving our actions, and taking cognizance of our behaviour; we ſhould be much more cautious and wary in our proſecutions, <hi>eſpecially in our demeanour while in God's Houſe. The Angels are our Guardians, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and guiding us to good;</hi> it ſhould therefore be our care to manage our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual concernment; with ſuch Chriſtian prudence, that they may continue our Keepers, while we live here; <hi>and receive our Souls at our deaths, and convey them into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s boſom.</hi> It is the higheſt ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſlight their directions, beſides a woful diſadvantage: For being not under their protection, the <hi>Evil Spirits have the opportunity of exerciſing their Wiles and Arts upon us,</hi> of filling us full of all iniquity, and bringing us to deſtruction both of Body and Soul. The Devil is called the <hi>Prince of the Air,</hi> and why he doth us no more miſchief, becauſe the <hi>Angels of God encamp
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102510:42"/>round about us,</hi> to keep and preſerve us from his power. If then we fooliſhly throw our ſelves from under their care and protection, by adhering to the luſts of the fleſh; <hi>this Prince of the Air,</hi> with his <hi>Diabolical Crew,</hi> having no obſtruction, enters into us, and our latter end becomes worſe than the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, The conſideration, that the Angels are our Guardians, ſhould encourage us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in our duty, and not be diſcouraged at difficulties;</hi> remembring that we have more for, than againſt us. Being compaſſed with ſo <hi>great a cloud of witneſſes, and mighty helpers, we are to lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which does ſo eaſily beſet us, and to run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> And having ſo great encouragement and conſolation, we are not at any time to be weary of well doing, or frightened from it; but to be <hi>ſledfaſt, unmoveable, always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Perſons of ſuch hopes for hereafter, (the Heirs of Salvation) and ſuch ſecurity in the interim (attended with the Holy Angels.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, The conſideration, that theſe Heavenly Courtiers are our Attendants and Guardians, ſhould engage us to honour and eſteem the meaneſt of Gods Servants;</hi> not to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102510:42"/>deſpiſe, reproach and load them with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing calumnies. <hi>How dareſt thou to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and ſlight one of Gods poor Servants, when they have Celeſtial Spirits attending them?</hi> They are the Sons and Daughters of the great King of Heaven and Earth, and born to a fair Inheritance, a tranſcendantly Rich and Glorious Kingdom: And in the mean while, however thou mayſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as deſtitute and forſaken, they have an <hi>inviſible Guard about them,</hi> upon occaſion to Miniſter for their ſupply, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and vindication; <hi>Such honour have all his Saints.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> ſmote the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> with blindneſs, becauſe they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed and provoked <hi>Lot.</hi> And though now a-days God does not ſo ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the indignities of his poor Servants, by open Judgments; yet he will be ſure to <hi>right them in the other world,</hi> by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour has repreſented the danger of contempt and uncharitableneſs towards the poor, in the caſe of the Rich Man; <hi>In Hell he lifted up his eyes, &amp; ſees Lazarus afar off,</hi> whom he ſuffered to periſh at his Gates; Of whoſe ſuccour he would have been glad; <hi>Send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102510:43"/>in deſpiſing the poor, we deſpiſe alſo Chriſt himſelf, who became poor, that we might be made rich: <hi>And what puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy of, who trample under foot the Son of God?</hi> Let us therefore, ſince we all are partakers of one hope of being Heirs of Salvation, <hi>High and Low, Rich and Poor,</hi> learn to reſpect and honour the meaneſt among us; eſpecially remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that God has given them a mighty priviledge of being attended and guarded by his <hi>Angels.</hi> But to conclude.</p>
            <p>Since theſe heavenly <hi>Guardians</hi> are holy, unſpotted, and undefiled Beings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light continually to ſing Praiſe, Honour, and Glory unto the Lamb that ſits upon the Throne; <hi>let us endeavour to emulabe them as much as is poſſible in this our frail ſtate; let us love and ſeek after thoſe things which belong to our everlaſting peace.</hi> Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our ſelves in Religion, chearfully and frequently. <hi>If thou delight in the word of God, and prayer</hi> ſays devout <hi>Gerard, thou ſhalt be gratified with the Holy Angels patronage. While I was ſpeaking and praying and confeſſing my ſin and the ſin of my people Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Daniel, and preſenting my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication before the Lord my God, for the Holy Mountain of my God; Yea, while I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, the Man Gabriel, whom I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102510:43"/>had ſeen in the Viſion at the beginning, being cauſed to fly ſwiftly, touched me about the time of the evening-oblation,</hi> Dan. 9.20, 21. This exerciſe the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> delight in; May God grant that we may be governed and guided by thoſe <hi>Celeſtial Spirits,</hi> whom he has commiſſioned and charged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about us; that they may ſuccour and defend us, <hi>while in this life; and when we dye, receive and carry our Souls into</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>boſom.</hi> And this we beg for Jeſus Chriſts ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>DEath is the Lot of us all,</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth the rich Man's Palace, as well as the poor Man's Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; he ſtorms the Princes Court, as well as the Peaſants meaner Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. High and Low, all muſt ſubmit, when this <hi>grim Serjeant</hi> makes a demand. Neither <hi>Wealth nor Honour; neither beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102510:44"/>nor wiſdom, nor any ſecular regard,</hi> can plead againſt death, or priviledge a Man from the Grave. Which conſideration ſhould inſinuate with Men to be <hi>leſs in love with this world, and more thoughtful of that time when they muſt go into a fixed ſtate, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of eternal happineſs, or miſery.</hi> But ſuch was the ſtupid folly of <hi>Dives,</hi> that to dye was the leaſt of his care, and the leaſt in his mind. His chief ſtudy was, what he ſhould <hi>eat, drink, and put on;</hi> what ſort of pleaſures would beſt ſuit with, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his ſenſes. In ſine, his happineſs was fixed in theſe periſhing enjoyments, and ſo fondly imagined his condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; But behold <hi>a woful change of things!</hi> In the midſt of his carnal ſecurity, death ſteps in, an unwelcome Gueſt, a frightful Spectrum, and irreſiſtably hauls him from all his darling repaſts, and <hi>crouds him into the Region of damned Spirits.</hi> Now he that was cloathed with Purple and fine Linnen, is inveloped in devouring and unquenchable flames; he that fared <hi>ſumptuouſly and deliciouſly every day,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a loathſom dungeon, and doomed to ſuſter thoſe intolerable preparations. And to enhance his Miſery, <hi>Lazarus, whom he uncharitably denyed the crumbs which fell from his Table,</hi> and without any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102510:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>reluctancy permitted to faint, languiſh, and dye at his Gates, <hi>is at a diſtance preſented to his view lying in</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſom,</hi> crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory, and encircled with the rades of eternal bliſs. To <hi>Abraham</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf, <hi>Pity my hard fate, conſider my woful condition, ſee how the flames ſcorch and torment me, ſee how my tongue is parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with heat; I am ſo miſerably afflicted, that I cannot expreſs my ſelf; I pray thee therefore to ſend</hi> Lazarus, <hi>with a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to abate the anguiſh, and allay the throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of my enflamed tongue.</hi> So great and vehement are the plagues of Hell, that the damned Spirits there cry continually for help and ſuccour, but are not pitiable Objects, having withſtood the frequent tenders of grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>Now from the words of the Text, we learn,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That as the Souls of true Believers, when they go out of their Bodies, launce into a fixed ſtate of happineſs; ſo the Souls of wicked men, immediately upon ſeparation, go into a fixed ſtate of miſery.</hi> We no ſooner read of the Rich Man being dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but it follows, <hi>And in Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That it will be a great part of the miſery of the damned, to underſtand thoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102510:45"/>to be in Heaven, whom they in this life ſcorned, reproached, and abuſed, and it may be were inſtruments of haſtening them to thoſe bleſſed Manſions.</hi> It was doubtleſs an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the rich Mans torments, to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom; that <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom be did brow-beat, and ſuffered to periſh with hunger at his own Gates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That there will come a time, when the moſt proud and ambitious ſinners, would gladly be relieved by the meaneſt Saints. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Abraham, ſays the rich Man, <hi>ſend</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, <hi>the very ſame who begg'd at my Gates for the crumbs which fell from my Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, That the ſtate of the damned will be void of the leaſt degrees of comfort.</hi> The rich Man deſired but the cooling of his tongue, with as much water as could be brought upon the tip of <hi>Lazarus's</hi> finger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, That the Tongue is a Member, the abuſe of which in another life, will lye very heavy upon loſt Souls.</hi> The chief member, which the rich man complained was moſt afflicted, was his Tongue; <hi>ſend</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and could my tongue.</hi> Intolerable are thoſe preparations in the other miſerable world. But concerning the former of theſe,</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102510:46"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That the Souls of wicked men, as-ſoon as they go out of their bodies, paſs into a fixed ſtate of miſery;</hi> Which we learn from the former part of the Text, <hi>The rich man alſo dyed, and was buried; and in Hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments:</hi> That is, his Soul was hurried by evil Spirits into a ſtate of miſery. His Body, we read, dyed, and was honourably and ſplendidly buried in the Earth, and there muſt reſt, till the great Creator bids it riſe in the laſt day, and then ſhall be re-united to its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Spirit, and both ſhare alike in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable torments, which God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ungodly men. It is therefore an idle fancy of ſome, who conceit that the Soul ſleepeth together with the Body, and remaineth unactive and inſenſible as the body. The Soul being a Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubject to death; and though its agility is much reſtrained, while confined in the body; yet as ſoon as it is delivered, it ſwiftly returns to its own place, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by good Angels into a ſtate of happineſs; or by evil Spirits, into a place of torments. And ſuch is the opinion of the wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The duſt, that is, the body, ſo termed from the matter of which it is compounded, returneth to the Earth again, as it was, and the Soul to him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102510:46"/>that gave it;</hi> to be ſentenced either to dwell with God, or damned Spirits for ever. And though the happineſs, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of departed Souls is not compleat, at the higheſt perfection, till that day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt will come in the <hi>glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the Holy Angels, to judge all the world;</hi> yet this no way favours the <hi>Romiſh Doctrine,</hi> which inſinuateth a Purgatory, a place where departed Spirits are purged by fire, and by the fervency of prayer, may be redeemed from thence, a moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle. <hi>As the tree falls, ſo it lyes,</hi> After this life, which is the time of Tryal and Probation, <hi>a fixed ſtate, either of bliſs or torment, commences:</hi> And a good Soul cannot then be deprived of happineſs, tho' not yet in the higheſt degree; but with exceeding joy, and a kind of holy impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, it waiteth for the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to enter on the poſſeſſion of thoſe good things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them <hi>who continue ſtedfaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in his work;</hi> Nor, on the other hand, can a wicked Soul be <hi>ranſomed from Hell,</hi> tho' it be not yet in the midſt of moſt exquiſite torments, but, with dread and fear, ſadly looks for the great and terrible day, wherein it muſt change its unhappy condition, for a much
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102510:47"/>worſe. Thoſe Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, are <hi>reſerved in chains under darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day;</hi> that is, they are not yet afflicted with thoſe puniſhments, which they ſhall feel and endure, when Chriſt comes to <hi>ſeparate the Sheep from the Goats.</hi> They are therefore ſaid to tremble at the thoughts of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Sentence ſhall paſs upon them to be confined in thoſe unhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencies of Miſery, and to undergo the utmoſt fury of an Omnipotent God. And tho' it is expreſſed, that the <hi>Rich man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead and buried, in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in torments;</hi> we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him in that place of Miſery, which wicked men ſhall be doomed to in the General Judgment; but in <hi>a ſtate of deſpair of Mercy, without any intermiſſion of hope,</hi> weeping and wailing for the loſs of Heaven, which <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, reviled, and ſuffered to periſh, has a ſure hope of. A ſtate of dread and fear, being too well convinced, that he muſt take up his Eternal Abode with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned Fiends. <hi>A ſtate of Torment too,</hi> his Conſcience ſadly bringing to his remembrance, that he played away the <hi>Day of Grace,</hi> and wilfully rejected the Methods of Eternal Happineſs: That he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102510:47"/>was too much taken up with the <hi>Pomp and Pride of life,</hi> ſpending all his time in catering for his Body, cloathing it with <hi>Purple and fine Linnen,</hi> and gorging it with delicious fare, but had no regard to his Soul, which muſt live for ever. <hi>This is Torment inexpreſſible,</hi> to reflect on thoſe things which cannot poſſibly be retrieved; to repent, and wiſh he had not been ſo fooliſh, without the leaſt hope of pardon; to ſigh and ſob, groan and howl, without pity. We may, in ſome meaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the uneaſineſs of this kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome who are ſo unfortunate to be in ſuch an ill frame of ſpirit, as to imbibe unworthy thoughts of God, that he is an <hi>inxorable Being,</hi> that he <hi>delighteth in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of his People, and will not be intreated for pardon,</hi> after ſuch an advancement in ſin, no, though they ſeek it with flouds of tears, with many prayers and penitential groans. <hi>What an Hell is there within the Breaſts of theſe dejected Souls!</hi> What an abundance of melancholy and frightful thoughts invade their minds! how do they wander hither and thither, <hi>like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Ghoſts,</hi> as if Sentence was already paſt upon them! Humane Converſation, or other ſublunary delights and pleaſures become dull and flatulent. Now, if in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102510:48"/>this life, ſuch an unhappy frame of ſpirit, occaſioned either by ſtrength of fancy, or <hi>too much tenderneſs of ſpirit,</hi> does diſorder and confuſe the mind, and make men their own Tormentors, tho' there is <hi>yet hopes of forgiveneſs from God;</hi> how infinitely more vexatious and afflicting muſt it needs be in the other World, to reflect that the <hi>time of Mercy is paſt,</hi> and that God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly paſs Sentence of Eternal Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, having no Advocate to plead, nor any Vertues to render it an Object of Mercy! And here, by way of <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> we will ſuppoſe <hi>the Cryes, the woful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Rich man's Soul in the other World;</hi> he is unexpectedly ſnatched away from all his Pomp and Greatneſs, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd into the <hi>wide World of Deſpairing Ghoſts. Whither am I hurried? Oh the doleful ſighs, and unutterable groans I hear! Mercy, Mercy, but there is none. Curſed be my folly, in living without a thought of this unhappy Region! Curſed be my heart, for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much the World, and worldly things; curſed be my avaricious humour, in retaining of pelf, as if I was never to die; curſed be my hands, that would not liberally diſpence to poor</hi> Lazarus. <hi>O that I was but to live my time over again, I would alter my very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make amends for all the wrongs I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102510:48"/>have done.</hi> Father <hi>Abraham, be moved by my recantation, pity me who am thus tormented; Let</hi> Lazarus, <hi>whom it repenteth me that I did not conſider and relieve, when it was in my power, come with ſome</hi> cooling drops, <hi>and allay my anguiſh. O that I had never been born! that I had given a groan, and dyed in my Mothers Womb! May that day be darkneſs, wherein it was ſaid,</hi> I was brought forth. <hi>Curſed be my Father that begat me; curſed be my Mother that bare me; curſed be the Place wherein I was Educated; curſed be the Purple and fine Linnen that cloathed me, the delicious Meats which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed me, and the Eſtate that made me live ſecure and thoughtleſs, till I was ſurprized into this place of weeping, wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus much for the firſt thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Souls of wicked Men, as ſoon as they go out of their Bodies, paſs into a fixed ſtate of miſery,</hi> tho' not the extremity of it, till the day of Judgment; yet it is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible, for there is no returning into this life again. I paſs on to the <hi>ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thing,</hi> namely,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it will be a great part of the miſery of the Damned, to understand thoſe to be in Heaven, whom they in this life ſcorned, reproached, and abuſed; and, it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102510:49"/>may be, were Inſtruments of haſtening them to thoſe bleſſed Manſions.</hi> It was, doubtleſs, an aggravation of the Rich Man's tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſee <hi>Lazarus in Abraham's boſom; that Lazarus,</hi> whom he formerly Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, and ſuffered to periſh with Hunger at his Gates. This Viſion could not but enhance his rage; he that was but a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, the very <hi>abject of Mankind,</hi> he that bowed and cringed for a little ſuſtenance, and was the moſt deſpicable Object in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he that would have been <hi>glad of the crumbs which fell from my Table,</hi> Is he thus advanced into Glory? And I, who once was of great repute, and had all things that were great, good, and deſirable, thus ſunk into the depth of Diſgrace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in a ſad and woful Eternity? <hi>O wretched change of things!</hi> Doubtleſs it will be brought to the memory of the Damned, how cruelly, deſpitefully, and diſdainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have treated the Servants of God in this Life, and fill them with rage and paſſion: <hi>For if Hell be a place, wherein are all the inſtances of torment, the perfection of miſery;</hi> it muſt follow, that whatſoever may tend to the unhappineſs of thoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inhabitants, will be <hi>eternally preſent</hi> with them; not only <hi>the outward Senſes, ſuch as the Sight, the Ear, the Smell,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102510:49"/>the Taſte, and Touching, ſhall be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tormented, but the inferior faculties alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Imaginative Faculty</hi> ſhall be perplexed with horrid Idea's, more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affrighting than the moſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fancy in their Dreams, and ſhall be hurried into ſtrange conſternations, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized into a kind of <hi>convulſive delirium;</hi> it ſhall never conceive a Notion, but what may diſturb, diſquiet, and make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveably uneaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Appetites</hi> ſhall be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fury of their own paſſions, and ſhall iſſue out, after a vehement man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; namely, fears, heavineſs, irkſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, agonies, anger, deſperations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, out-rages, with ſuch <hi>a cruel War among themſelves, that they ſhall claſh, and make moſt horrid noiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Intellectual Memory</hi> ſhall be tormented with a continual and fixed Recordation, of the many opportunities and advantages there once were of getting to Heaven; the <hi>many offers of Grace</hi> which have been ſtubbornly refuſed; the many affronts and injuries that have been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God and his Saints; the good things it formerly poſſeſſed; the evils it ſuffers at preſent, and thoſe it muſt painfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102510:50"/>to all Eternity: So that it cannot <hi>think or imagine any thing, but what will grieve and torment it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> ſhall be darkned, without being able to diſcourſe, or underſtand any thing that may pleaſe it; it ſhall be full of Errors and Illuſions, pondering and exaggerating his own Evils, and judging, with a furious boldneſs, that God Almighty doth him wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> ſhall be obſtinate and obdurate in his ſins, and in the <hi>hatred of God and his Saints,</hi> without being able to be appeaſed or changed, or to repent what it does; and deſiring to do his own Will, he ſhall never be able to do it in any thing that may be for his comfort; whereupon a Mans own Will, not being fulfilled, <hi>ſhall be the Hell of it ſelf,</hi> to chaſtize it for thoſe manifold times, that in this Life it was fulfilled, contrary to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>But furthermore: It may chance to be objected, <hi>How ſhall the Damned know that thoſe are in Heaven, who in this Life they ſcorned and abuſed, and poſſibly were Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſome violent means, of haſtening them thither?</hi> I anſwer; That in the day of Judgment, when every Man's actions ſhall be diſcloſed, they ſhall ſee thoſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102510:50"/>whom they oppreſſed, or reviled, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ſhall be Witneſſes againſt them. Our Saviour ſpeaks in alluſion to this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.41, 42. <hi>The men of Nineveh ſhall riſe up in judgment with this generation, and condemn it;</hi> they ſhall appear as ſo many Witneſſes againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the other unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> of this Age, and ſhall be Inſtruments, as to that Condemnation which God ſhall that day pronounce againſt them, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not at the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> but theſe would not at the preaching of Chriſt. Then ſhall appear <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> againſt a wicked <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who cauſed them to be bound hand and foot, and caſt into a fiery Furnace, for their Love and Loyalty to their God, the <hi>Martyrs againſt their Executioners;</hi> and ſhall be viſibly condemned, and haled into their reſidences of Miſery in the <hi>preſence of the Saints.</hi> And, O the unconceiveable rage and fury of thoſe condemned Spirits, when all their Villanies are brought <hi>freſh to their memories,</hi> to add to thoſe other torments which Divine Juſtice has prepared in the Regions below! O how will they curſe and blaſpheme that God that has Doomed them to Hell, and burn with anger againſt their Accuſers! And that which enhances
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102510:51"/>their torments, is, That it is out of their power to harm them. Hell is therefore repreſented in Scripture. <hi>A place where is gnaſhing of Teeth;</hi> which betokeneth rage, malice, and envy. And thus much for the ſecond thing we learn from the words of the Text, namely, <hi>That it will be a great part of the miſery of the Damned, to underſtand that they are in Heaven, who in this Life they ſcorned, reproached, and abuſed; and, it may be, were Inſtruments of haſtening them thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other remaining Heads, namely,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the time is coming, when the moſt proud and ambitious Sinners would gladly be relieved by the meaneſt Saints;</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Petition of the Rich Man to <hi>Abraham; Father Abraham, ſend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the ſame whom I denied the crumbs which fell from my Table.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the ſtate of the Damned will be void of the leaſt degree of comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the <hi>Tongue is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the abuſe of which in this Life, will lie very heavy upon loſt Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, by Divine permiſſion, ſhall be my buſineſs to prove, the next opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I ſhall proceed now to make ſome ſpecial uſe of what has been ſaid, and ſo conclude. And here,</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102510:51"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Has God prepared a Hell for ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men? A place where ſhall be eternal weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth?</hi> Let it then be our greateſt Induſtry, ſo to live, as to avoid it. Certainly the pleaſures of Sin are not ſo profitable and raviſhing, as to <hi>charm Men into endleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi> For, alas, what will it avail a <hi>damned Ghoſt,</hi> that he once had his fill of ſenſual Delights and Satisfactions, that he lived in Eaſe and Security, <hi>ſince now all Objects are removed from him, wherein he ſolaced himſelf,</hi> and he doomed to ſuffer the dire effects of an unappeaſed Vengeance for ever? To be wracked and tormented by the <hi>never-dying Worm,</hi> and to endure the vehement heat of an unquenchable Fire. <hi>Is there any compare between the pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a moment, and a lamentable Eternity? An Hell,</hi> which is a fixed ſtate of Miſery, wherein Men have bid adieu to the pleaſures of Earth, and all hopes of Heaven; the memory of paſt Pleaſures doth but increaſe their Pain; and, what is beyond all the miſery of this World, they enjoy not ſo much as <hi>the deceitful dreams of flattering hopes. An Hell,</hi> where there is no delight, nor eaſe, nor <hi>God,</hi> nor any harmleſs <hi>pleaſure</hi> to divert the <hi>pain</hi> a moment. <hi>An Hell,</hi> where only the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102510:52"/>Objects of an incenſed God do for ever weep and wail. Are you able to live out an eternity among theſe dreadful <hi>Preparations?</hi> And why therefore will you love and practiſe Sin, which is threatned with eternal death? Is there any greater Folly imaginable, than to <hi>hug our own Ruine, and to play with Hell?</hi> Conſider, I beſeech you, how terrible it is, to be for ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from <hi>God, Angels, and Saints;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Regions of Darkneſs, and <hi>tormented in Flames</hi> which cannot be quenched. To be whipped with Snakes, ſtung with Scorpions, and to have all the Inſtruments of Torture applied to the Body: Theſe are infinitely more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than thoſe Pains which God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for ungodly Sinners. O that Men were ſo wiſe, to conſider theſe things, and labour, by a prudent management of their Concerns, to avoid them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>And in conſideration, that the Soul paſſes into a fixed ſtate, as ſoon as it goes out of the Body; it is Folly in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, to delay and put off our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Preparation for a long Eternity;</hi> becauſe we hang but by ſlender Strings, a little Breath that expires every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, over the bottomleſs Pit. We are ſubject to ſo many Accidents and Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102510:52"/>that, as it were, <hi>we carry our Lives in our Hands.</hi> And what a ſad Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is it, to be <hi>ſurpriſed into another World,</hi> and the work of our Souls left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought and imperfect? Then the time of Trial is over, and as we died, ſo will our Portion be. <hi>The tenders of Grace and Mercy then ceaſe,</hi> and we wait with the ſad expectation of a general Judgment, then to receive according to <hi>that we have done in the Fleſh. How terrible, O impenitent Sinner, will Death be to thee? and what a concern wilt thou be in at its approach?</hi> when thou muſt leave all the pleaſures of thy Sins, and the remembrance of them fills thee only with Terror and Aſtoniſhment; when all their falſe Charms, and <hi>meretrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Looks,</hi> whereby they have before plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and enchanted thee, go off; and they now <hi>look ghaſtly and frightful,</hi> and ſtare thee in the Face with a ſcaring appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and with the ſad apprehenſion of what they are like to end in. <hi>When a dreadful Eternity preſents it ſelf before thee, and is like to ſwallow thee up in a horrid Abyſs of Miſery; when thou comeſt ſo nigh to the other World, that thou canst look over as it were to it, and ſee the ſad reception thou art like to have there; when thou ſeeſt</hi> Hell open <hi>before thee, the bottomleſs Pit
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102510:53"/>gaping to receive thee, and ſome of the Flames of it flaſhing as it were out upon thee; when Death, like an Executioner, comes to ſeiſe and apprehend thee, and hurry thee before the dreadful Tribunal, where all thy past Actions must be examined, all thy ſecret Sins laid open, and a dreadful Sentence ſhall be immediately pronounced upon thee.</hi> Is not the Conſideration of this, enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Men, who have their Wits about them, to <hi>break off their Sins timely by Repentance,</hi> and apply themſelves to a ſerious thoughtfulneſs of their latter end? <hi>Should a damned Spirit be permitted to come from the Region of Miſery, to tell thee how intolerable thoſe Preparations are, what Pain and Anguiſh thoſe wretched Ghoſts endure, thou ſaist it may be that thou wouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> but if thou wilt not be convinced by the aſſertions of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it is to be preſumed nothing beſides can have effect upon thee, as <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered the rich Man in that <hi>Parable,</hi> who deſired him to ſend ſome <hi>Spirit to his ſurviving Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, to ſcare them to Repentance: If they will not believe Moſes and the Prophets, they will not be perſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102510:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly:</hi> And ſince we are promiſed all the aſſiſtance imaginable, to fit us for thoſe Manſions of Bliſs, <hi>let us not be ſo injurious to our ſelves, as to be lacking on our parts.</hi> Let us offer violence to our ſtubborn Wills, wean our Affections from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Sin, and mortifie the Fleſh, till it is brought in ſubjection to the Spirit, <hi>and intirely ſubmiſſive to the Law of Reaſon.</hi> Let us improve the means of Grace, and be purely governed by the motions of God's Spirit. <hi>What a comfortable Death will ſuch a regular and well-managed Life produce?</hi> All ſlaviſh fears, miſgivings, frightful thoughts, and terrible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, will flee away, <hi>and a proſpect of the Heavenly</hi> Canaan <hi>will preſent it ſelf; we ſhall have a view of that glorious reception we are like to have, which will ſweeten the agonies of Death, lift us up under the preſſure of a ſore Diſeaſe, and carry us out of the World with a ſolid hope of entering into our Maſters joy.</hi> And here the Soliloquy of a Soul, that is ready to paſs out of this World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better: <hi>I a poor Creature of this World below; I who have felt the troubles of this Mortal State, been tortured by the Paſſions of Fleſh and Blood, Fears and Cares, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and Hopes; even I am going into a Heaven, where none of theſe can enter, where
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102510:54"/>I ſhall be made happy with theſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which make God and Angels ſo; I ſhall be made equal to the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how far above them in my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! For what a value will the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this World make me ſet upon the joys of another! The ſence and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Miſery, will make my Heaven double.</hi> Oh! The mighty Raptures and Extaſies this holy Soul falls into, till it is ſwallowed up in uninterrupted Joys, and holy Wonder! And ſince there is far leſs trouble in Virtue, than in Sin; and ſince the Reward of each is ſo vaſtly different; how blameable, and worthy of Condemnation are they, who refuſe the former, and chuſe the latter?</p>
            <p>Let none of us then, for the <hi>ſake of a few ſhort-liv'd Pleaſures,</hi> run our ſelves in danger of being caſt into a miſerable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wherein we ſhall ſorely repent of our Inadvertencies, and ſtubborn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſes, and wiſh we had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in time. Let us therefore, with our Church, pray; <hi>O Almighty God, the Protector of all that truſt in thee, without whom nothing is ſtrong, nothing is holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply upon us thy Mercy; that thou being our Ruler and Guide, we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102510:54"/>may ſo paſs through things Temporal, that we finally loſe not the things Eternal.</hi> And thus we beg for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, to whom with the Father, and the ever Bleſſed Spirit, be given all Honour, Praiſe, Thankſgiving, and Obedience, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>—The Rich man alſo died, and was buried.</p>
               <p>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſees <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſom:</p>
               <p>And he cried, and ſaid, Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> have mercy on me, and ſend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my Tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
            </q>
            <p>WHen I enter'd upon theſe words, you may remember I raiſed theſe following particulars from them. As <hi>Firſt, That as the Souls of true Believers, when they go out of their Bodies, launch into a fixed ſtate of Bleſſedneſs; ſo the Souls of wicked men paſs into a fixed ſtate of Miſery.</hi> We no ſooner read of the Rich man's being <hi>dead and buried; but in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in torment. Secondly, That it will be a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102510:55"/>great part of the miſery of the damned, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe to be in Heaven, whom, in this life, they ſcorned, reproached, and abuſed, and it may be were Inſtruments of haſtening them to thoſe bleſſed Manſions.</hi> It was doubtleſs a great aggravation of the Rich man's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, when he ſaw <hi>Lazarus in Abraham's boſom,</hi> that <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom he ſuffered to periſh with hunger at his Gates. <hi>Thirdly, That the time will come, when the moſt proud and ambitious Sinners would gladly be relieved by the meaneſt Saints:</hi> Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſays the Rich man, ſend <hi>Lazarus, the very ſame who begg'd for the crumbs which fell from my Table. Fourthly, That the ſtate of the damned will be void of the leaſt degrees of comfort. The Rich man deſired but the cooling of his Tongue, but with as much Water as could be brought upon the tip of</hi> Lazarus<hi>'s finger. Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>That the Tongue is a member, the abuſe of which in another life, will lie very heavy upon loſt Souls.</hi> The chief member which the Rich man complained was moſt afflicted, was his <hi>Tongue; Send</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.</hi> As concerning the former of theſe <hi>That the Souls of wicked Men, when they go out of their Bodies, paſs into a fixed ſtate of miſery.</hi> I urged, that though their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will not be compleat till the day
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102510:56"/>of Judgment, when Soul and Body ſhall be re-united, and ſentence paſs upon them, yet their condition is irreverſible, no changing it for a better; but there they weep and howl for the loſs of Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach themſelves for their obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſes, in neglecting the opportunities, and ſlighting the means of happineſs; and ſadly expect the day of Judgment, having too much Reaſon to believe, they ſhall be caſt and condemned at that formidable <hi>Audit Hence,</hi> I told you, <hi>the Devils are ſaid to fear and tremble, being convinced that they ſhall at the laſt reckoning be thrown into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> And therefore it is ſpoken by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fallen Angels, that kept not their firſt Eſtate, having violated thoſe everlaſting Laws given to them by their Creator; <hi>They are reſerved in chains, under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> That is, they are not in that extremity of torment, which they ſhall endure, when Jeſus Chriſt cometh with ten thouſand of Saints, to convince all that are ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their ungodly ſpeeches which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him. <hi>As to the ſecond particular,</hi> namely, <hi>That it will be a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102510:56"/>great part of the miſery of the damned, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe to be in Heaven, whom they, in this life ſcorned, reproached, and abuſed, and, it may be, were inſtruments of haſtening them to thoſe bleſſed Manſions;</hi> I urged, that if Hell be a Place, where all the victims to Divine Juſtice muſt for ever reſide, and where are all the inſtances of torment, it is not to be doubted but this will be one inſtance of their puniſhment, to underſtand thoſe are in a ſtate of glory, who, while in this world, they cloathed with diſhonour, and treated with diſgrace, and infamy, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their rage and paſſion to froth up, and boyl againſt them, ſent them into the other life before the time. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more exaſperates and frets a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, than to ſee one whom he oweth a grudge, or has no common reſpect for, thrive and get wealth; this fills him with indignation and fury, and makes him very uneaſie, as often as he meets with, or thinks of the Object of his hate, or when a Diſcourſe ariſes about him: Then is he big with wiſhes for his entire ruine; &amp; that which improves his unhappineſs is, it is not in his power to miſchief or harm him, by all his baſe and envious contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt him. And what an aggravation of the miſery of the damned muſt it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102510:57"/>needs be, to know and underſtand thoſe to be in Heaven, whom they in this world envied, reproached and ſpake all manner of evil againſt. Whatſoever may torment the interiour faculties, and make them at diſcord and variance, ſhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And after an enlargement upon this Point, I proceeded to draw ſome practical Inferences, and then cloſed. My buſineſs then is now, to go on to the third Thing, namely,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the time will come, when the moſt proud and ambitious ſinners would gladly be relieved by the meaneſt Saints. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham,</hi> ſays the Rich Man, <hi>ſend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, that Lazarus who came to my Gates in tattered cloathing, with a wan, and meagre countenance, being pinched with hunger, and begged for the crumbs which fell from my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> We know how much againſt the grain it goes, when fate ſo diſpoſes matters, and turns the harmony of things, for a man, who once lived in good repute and faſhion, had all things which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and uſeful, and made his life pleaſant and comfortable; to beg cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies of another, who was formerly poor and deſpicable, when he was a favourite of fortune, and probably deny'd him both reſpect and ſupplies: how doth he <hi>pro and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102510:57"/>con</hi> with himſelf, before he can come to ſuch an humble temper, to ask the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of an enemy whom he made ſo, and brook the inſolent language and flat denials, he may probably meet with from him? <hi>Former unkindneſſes do not preſently ſlip out of mind.</hi> But the ſenſe of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wants, and of the inconveniences which attend him by reaſon of his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fall, out-weighs the ſenſe of his ill natur'd carriage, and the reaſon he has to fear, the ſame meaſure he met will be meaſured to him again. There is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the point, poverty and urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity preſſes him to it againſt his will. How much elated and puffed up ſoever he was, when in a flourſhing ſtate, though then never ſo haughty and aſpiring; yet now he muſt <hi>cringe and kneel, change his ill nature, or at leaſt diſſemble a good one, and appear in all the circumſtances of an humble Supplicant.</hi> Now if ſuch an alteration of affairs in this life does grate upon the mind, and makes a man probably more unhappy, than his preſent mean condition; what a torment will it be to the damned in Hell, to be ſenſible that their miſeries could be abated by the <hi>meaneſt Saints in Heaven,</hi> even by thoſe, whom they moſt ſcornfully treated, and ſhamefully abuſed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102510:58"/>in this life? but ſhall beg, and wiſh, and deſire, to no purpoſe; how will they rage, and flame with indignation, againſt thoſe <hi>glorified Souls who are carried into</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſom,</hi> where they ſhall never weep, nor ſigh, nor ſorrow more, where a part of their happineſs is, to know that they are fallen as ſo many victims to Divine Juſtice, who in this world grieved, and vexed, and harraſſed them, by their unreaſonable dealings, and inhumane contrivances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. <hi>Could but the raies of bliſs glance through ſome cranny into that dungeon of darkneſs, this would adminiſter ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> or if thoſe happy Spirits above would vouchſafe to deſcend, and viſit thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Ghoſts, and pity their irreparable and loſt condition, it would divert their anguiſh, and make their long eternity more tolerable; but ſuch is the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and determinate will of God, that thoſe terrible preparations, which he has provided for his Enemies, ſhall <hi>never be mingled with the leaſt inſtance of conſolation;</hi> as thoſe bleſſed Manſions he has fixed for the reception of his obedient Children, ſhall never be <hi>interrupted with contrarieties; and ſo the Saints injoy perfect happineſs, and the damned ſuffer perfect miſery,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of every thing which may mitigate
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102510:58"/>and aſſwage the pains of Hell, they muſt endure the abſence of all good, and ſuffer the preſence of all evil. And here we will ſuppoſe the <hi>conflicts of the rich man,</hi> and inſert thoſe probable lamentations he may make, in his eternal baniſhment from all hopes of a return. <q> When I was in proſperity, I inſulted over poverty, and fooliſhly imagined no evil ſhould happen to me. I lived ſplendidly every day, and had all things at my beck, which were raviſhing and pleaſurable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidered the preſſing wants, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hardſhips of indigent perſons. I too ſadly remember, how imperious and curriſh I behaved my ſelf to impoveriſh'd <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was laid at my Gates full of the Leproſie, and juſt famiſhed; he begged, he beſeeched me to help him in his extremity, but I would not. Had he required any thing conſiderable, I might have deny'd him with a plauſible excuſe; but he ask'd only for the waſt crumbs which fell from my Table; and I, wretch that I was, ſent him away empty. What hardneſs poſſeſſed me! To what a height of inhumanity was I arrived! And now what a woful change is here! That ſame <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in Heaven and made amends for thoſe hardſhips
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102510:59"/>he patiently endured and ſuffered, in the other life, and I am ſunk down by the weight of my own guilt into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Miſery! How glad ſhould I be of the leaſt comfort from him, if it were but a drop of water upon the tip of his finger, to cool my Tongue! Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> diſpatch him from thoſe glorious Regions, to anſwer my ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Was I re-inſtated in my wealth, pomp, and ſplendor, had I a Million of Gold, I would exchange it with him for one drop of water. But it is too late to wiſh, and too late to beg for mercy; the ſentence is paſt, and I am condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer the extremity of it. </q> Doubtleſs it will be brought to the memories of the Damned, how cruelly, deſpitefully, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully they have uſed the Saints; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious they were in raiſing evil reports of them, how forward to revenge injuries upon them, how bitter in denying them a <hi>morſel of bread</hi> to ſuſtain their hunger; how they mocked and ſcoffed at them, and triumphed over them in their extremity, Every thing ſhall be brought to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, which may enhance their rage and add to their torments. Methinks I hear one of thoſe unhappy wretches thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf, <hi>How many times might I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102510:59"/>have prayed, but fooliſhly ſpent that time in play, but now I pay for it? How often ought I to have humbled and mortified my fleſh with faſting, but neglected it, to gratifie my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable appetite? How many Objects of pity might I have relieved, but Epicure like ſpent their portions in revells and exceſs? What opportunities have I had of forgiving my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but, indulging a ſpleenfull and deadly Spirit, rather choſe to be revenged? How many fair invitations have I had to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper, but not willing to quit the occaſion of ſinning, refuſed to be a gueſt at his Table? There never wanted any means of ſerving God, but I, inconſiderate wretch, had no inclination to uſe them; being too much inamoured with the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life: Now it repenteth me, that I was ſo thoughtleſs, and took ſo little care of my future ſtate; were I admitted to live the days that are paſt, over again, I would conſult new methods, and be very exact, juſt, and ſincere, in all my actions relating to God and Man: But theſe reſolves are fruitleſs; my ſtate is fixed, the ſentence is gone forth, and I doomed to ſuffer the moſt horrid and intolerable effects of it.</hi> Thus, in Hell, ſhall every thing be revived, and brought afreſh to remembrance, which may add to the torment of the <hi>interiour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102510:60"/>faculties;</hi> and this is ſignified by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in Scripture, <hi>They ſhall be caſt into Hell, where the worm dyeth not, and where ſhall be everlaſting weeping, wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi> And thus much may ſuffice for the third thing, namely, <hi>That the time will come, when the moſt proud and ambitious Sinners would gladly be relieved by the meaneſt Saints in Heaven.</hi> And this leads me on to the fourth;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, That the State of the damned will be void of the leaſt degrees of comfort. The Rich man deſired but the cooling of his tongue, with as much water as could be brought upon the tip of</hi> Lazarus<hi>'s finger.</hi> One of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients deſcribes Hell to be a place, where there is <hi>neque lumen, neque Deus, neque bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num minimum;</hi> no light, no God, nor any harmleſs pleaſure to divert the pains there one moment. <hi>As Heaven</hi> is ſeparate from from all evils, where thoſe glorified Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſwim in rapturous pleaſures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, nothing ſhall call them off from their enjoyments, no <hi>ſad circumſtances to imbitter their delights;</hi> no fears or ſollicitudes to abate their gladneſs, nor temptation to diſturb or moleſt them: <hi>So Hell</hi> is ſeparate from every and the leaſt good; thoſe <hi>damned wretches there ſhall have nothing in view, but frightful ſhapes, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102510:60"/>amazing appearances;</hi> nothing in <hi>Hearing,</hi> but diſmal groanings, ſcreechings, the thunderings of God's unappeaſed anger, and other unutterable noiſes; the ſenſe of <hi>Touching</hi> ſhall be tortured with the quick and piercing heat of unquenchable flames, their cryes ſhall never move the Almighty to diſmiſs either Angels or Saints to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage their pains, <hi>or to ſhorten their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> when a thouſand years are paſt in that lothſome and fiery Dungeon, they will be but as one day. There they ſhall <hi>deſire, without ſatisfaction; wiſh, but not obtain; repent, without effect; and live out a long eternity in unmixed perplexities. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> writes of <hi>Trizus</hi> the Tyrant, that he was ſuch an Enemy to the Liberty and Comfort of his Subjects, that he prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Converſation one with another, and uſing ſignatures or tokens, whereby they might underſtand each others purpoſes and meanings, he forbad that alſo; they lying under the burden of this unparallel'd Tyrany, met together at the Market-place to weep for their misfortunes, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted this too, leſt they ſhould miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their ſorrows by condoling of one another. But greater ſhall be the rigour in Hell, where ungodly Sinners ſhall not be permitted to ſpeak one word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102510:61"/>nor eaſe their Maladies with Tears. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet lamented the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſhe was brought into Bondage, and became a Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and Tributary. But what Tears are ſufficient to <hi>bewail the damnation of a poor Soul,</hi> who, from an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven, hath made himſelf a Slave to the Devil, and thoſe eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell, unto which he is <hi>to pay as many Tributes, as he hath Senſes, Powers, and Members?</hi> And thus much for the Fourth Particular, namely, <hi>That the ſtate of the Damned will be void of the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Comfort; which we learn from the rich Man's deſiring but the cooling of his Tongue, with as much Water as could be brought upon the tip of</hi> Lazarus<hi>'s Finger.</hi> I go on therefore to the Fifth and laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, namely.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>That the Tongue is a Member, the abuſe of which, in another Life, will lie very heavy upon leſt Souls. The Rich Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that his Tongue in chief was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſays he, ſend</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my Tongue.</hi> Whereby we are adviſed, that the Damned ſuffer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proportionable to their offences; as this wicked wretch ſuffered four exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102510:61"/>terrible. <hi>The firſt of Flames,</hi> which covered him all over, from the Feet unto the Head: <hi>I am tormented in this flame,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the vanity of the ſoft and purple Garments, wherewith he had been cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>The ſecond of his Tongue,</hi> which as it was the Inſtrument of his Gluttony, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and Talkativeneſs; ſo was it burnt in the fire, and tormented with moſt terrible Hunger, and enraged Thirſt. <hi>The third of Envy,</hi> ſeeing by revelation the comfortable and bleſſed Lott of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> of whom he durſt demand nothing, but of <hi>Abraham. The fourth of Contempt, and Dereliction</hi> of every one, in chaſtiſement of his cruelty, for which he found no mercy at the hands of <hi>Abraham; not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording him the drop of Water, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, becauſe he had denied thoſe crumbs of Bread, which fell from his Table, to poor Lazarus:</hi> nor did he deſerve mercy, who ſhewd none.</p>
            <p>Whether there be a <hi>Material Fire</hi> in Hell, I cannot poſitively determine; yet there are two Reaſons to be given, which fairly argue that there is. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>Our Bleſſed Saviours diſcourſing of the pains of Hell, not only terms them weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth, &amp; a never-dying Worm, but flames that cannot
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102510:62"/>be quenched.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes Hell, <hi>A Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, which torments the Damned day and night, for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 20.10. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon is, <hi>The ſame Bodies which are buried in the Earth, muſt be raiſed again, and be re-united to their particular Spirits, and be made Immortal.</hi> Now I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the Body can ſuffer pain, ſo much as by <hi>Fire;</hi> and that being of a piercing nature, and moſt afflicting, we may very reaſonably conjecture, that there is a <hi>fire prepared by God for impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to chaſtize their Bodies for their acts of Luſt:</hi> and in theſe flames all the <hi>outward Senſes</hi> ſhall be tormented, and all the Members, particularly the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which in this Life was uſed to Curſing and Swearing, to Lying, Cheating, and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; which was accuſtomed to <hi>blaſpheme God and Providence, to ridicule his Religion and Worſhip, and to ſpeak evil of the Saints; which was Inſtrumental of Gluttony, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and obſcene Diſcourſes:</hi> But how, and in what nature, the <hi>Tongue</hi> muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, will be time enough for Sinners to underſtand, when they come there. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that Omnipotence has prepared the moſt exquiſite miſeries for thoſe who live and die in ſin. In fine, all that is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102510:62"/>evil and irkſom, all that is grievous and painful, whatſoever may <hi>compleat and make up a miſerable and woful Eternity,</hi> is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made ready for all thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate wretches, who ſhall be ſunk into the fatal Abyſs, by the weight of their own guilt. And thus much for the fifth and laſt particular, <hi>That the Tongue is a Member, the abuſe of which, in another life, will lie very heavy upon loſt Souls.</hi> And now I proceed to draw ſome Practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from what has been ſaid, and ſo conclude. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What love and affection do we owe to Almighty God, for his tender compaſſions towards us, in bearing with our weakneſſes, and not revenging our ſtubborn perverſeneſſes, by ſuddenly casting us into this diſmal place of Hell?</hi> How many has he rigorouſly ſent weeping into the fatal Abyſs? The <hi>Angels</hi> had no ſooner committed the ſin, but they were immediately baniſhed from their Happineſs, and now are <hi>reſerved in Chains under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the Great Day.</hi> What multitudes of others are now ſuffering the dire effects of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeas'd vengeance, for a leſs number of ſins than we are guilty of; and who, if they had been permitted to live, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might have <hi>be thought themſelves, changed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102510:63"/>their Minds and Nature, and become as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Vertue, as ever they were notorious for Vice?</hi> Why does not Almighty Juſtice take the advantage, and, for our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, tumble us into the <hi>Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone?</hi> Why does he yet bear with our inſolent carriage, and ſuffer the affronts we daily offer to his Majeſty? Wherefore does he ſpare the <hi>Blaſphemous Perſon, the Common Swearer,</hi> who impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rend his Sacred Name at every turn? Wherefore does he, who can by a word of his Mouth, by a blaſt of the breath of his Noſtrils, <hi>cruſh proud Mortals</hi> into the unhappy Reſidences of Miſery, from whence there can be no Redemption, ſtill endure their treacherous Infidelities, and many wilful Miſcarriages? <hi>What does he diſcern in us, that ſhould move him to ſuch impunity and forbearance?</hi> Nothing in us, but it is his Goodneſs, which dilates it ſelf over the whole Earth. Can ſuch Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Graciouſneſs then ſlip out of our Minds, and be buried in Oblivion? Can we think any thing too much to do for ſuch a benign Being, who loveth us far beyond the love of Parents? Might any of thoſe <hi>curſed Spirits below, be permitted to re-enter this World, and live another life in this Mortal State, how thankful would they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102510:63"/>be?</hi> How wary and circumſpect in their reſpective Vocations, how tender of their Innocency, how ſincere in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>They would pluck out a Right Eye, cut off a Right Hand, or Foot, rather than to have all their Members, and caſt into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched;</hi> they would cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Memory of ſuch a Redemption, with a faithful and conſtant ſubmiſſion to the Will of God. How then ſhould we live, live to him, who yet ſpareth us, and preſerves us from the bottomleſs Pit? Let us then ſhake off that improvidence which detaineth us, bethink our ſelves, renew our Spirits, change our very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>no longer live to our ſelves, but unto him who loveth us</hi> beyond meaſure. Our Debts are many and great, our Scores with God are large and numerous, and <hi>he has not yet caſt us into Priſon, from whence we muſt not come out till we have paid the uttermoſt farthing:</hi> Let this merciful and gracious Creditor therefore be rever'd, honoured, eſteemed, and ſerved by us, ſo will he at length give us <hi>a clear diſcharge</hi> from all future demands, and make us Rulers over all his Goods.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:102510:64"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From the premiſes, we learn to exerciſe our patience under the evils and miſeries of this Life.</hi> Worldly misfortunes are not to be compared to thoſe unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which attend loſt Souls; the former, either by the help of Friends, or ſome means or other, may be repaired; or if not, their malignity is abated, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that they will not laſt always; <hi>for we muſt die, and there is an end of all Earthly troul les.</hi> But the torments of Hell are durable and eternal, no redemption from thence, nor is there any thing that can eaſe the miſerable wretches there. There is no condition in this Life, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo uncomfortable, never ſo deſpicable and grievous, but the <hi>Damned would very gladly exchange their ſtate for it,</hi> and think themſelves infinitely bettered, as having parted with an eternally miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which admits of no abatements, for a temporally evil one, and which may be accommodated by ſome Inſtruments or other. When therefore thou falleſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Poverty,</hi> and the World brow-beats thee, think of the <hi>Poverty the Damned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; they are deprived of the</hi> ſummum bonum, <hi>the chiefeſt good, even God, and in him of all other ſenſible goods.</hi> When thou art deſpiſed and hated, that thou art ready
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102510:64"/>to be betrayed into dejection, deſperation, and diſconſolateneſs, ponder with thy ſelf, how the <hi>tormented Souls in Hell are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſpiſed, reproached by God, Angels, and Saints, and that World</hi> without end, &amp; muſt undergo the unappeaſed vengeance of an offended Deity. When thou art ſeized and oppreſſed with a Fever, and thy blood in a violent ferment, conſider <hi>what heats and pains loſt Souls feel in Hell, inveloped in devouring flames, and every part and member of their Bodies expoſed to that ſcorching fire;</hi> doubtleſs it would very much tend to the eaſement of Mens mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and render the worſt condition in this Life more tolerable, if Men did often entertain themſelves with the thoughts of thoſe unſpeakable preparations, which Divine Juſtice has provided for impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners. <hi>Who would not rather ſuffer an Eye to be plucked out, an Arm or Leg to be cut off; nay, to be Rack'd, or to have all the Inſtruments of tortures apply'd to him, than to be caſt both Soul and Body into Hell, where the Worm dies not, and the fire is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> The ſence of a greater, does divert a leſſer affliction; and hereby Men are more appeaſed under unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when they ſee others more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly dealt with, and proclaim their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102510:65"/>grievances with hideous cries, groans, and fearful lamentations. In like manner, <hi>a view, by thought of the other miſerable World, and the pains and agonies the Damned there do ſuffer, will make Men bear any temporal affliction, with more patience and ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly <hi>and</hi> Laſtly, <hi>We learn, from the conſideration that God has prepared a Hell, to torment and pain thoſe who die in enmity with him, to hate every ſin, ſince it produces ſo woful an effect</hi> This is it which God abhors and therefore has contrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable Plagues to puniſh it. Now he manifeſts his averſion to ſin, by mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it with future torments; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after his threats will be put in execution, in <hi>raining down indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh, upon every Soul that dies in an impenitent ſtate.</hi> Where is the ſence then, of <hi>ſporting our ſelves in vicious repaſts, if we are like to pay ſo dear in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World for it? What is a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? What if he were as Wealthy as</hi> Croeſus, <hi>as Great as</hi> Alexander, <hi>had the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and all the Delights and Pleaſures thereof at his beck, if, when he dies, he muſt deſcend into the Regions of Sorrow, and be locked up in the Priſon of Hell for ever and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102510:65"/>ever?</hi> What will it avail him, that once he was Rich and Honourable, ſince now all the Goods that ever he had are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into flames? <hi>Hell comprehends a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of all Good, and the preſence of every Evil;</hi> and one would imagine, that the very thoughts of it were enough to damp Mens ſpirits, and to make them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhun the <hi>breach of their Innocence;</hi> that they would caution them againſt Temptations, and fill their Minds with <hi>Wiſe Conſiderations. When Men draw ſo near to a woful Eternity, that they can, as it were, look over to it; when they ſee the Grim and Terrible Serjeant</hi> Death, <hi>coming to hale them into another World,</hi> then they will be terrified and amazed, and cry out againſt thoſe ſins they formerly delighted in, and will wiſh they had been ſo wiſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to have conſidered the unhappy and fatal conſequences of Vice, that they might have avoided it in time of <hi>health and ſtrength.</hi> And why will not Sinners come to a ſerious and a right frame of Mind now, ſince they know they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thoſe things with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which now they glory in, when they lie languiſhing?</p>
            <p>If therefore we would <hi>eſcape thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which God Almighty has prepared in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102510:66"/>the other miſerable World,</hi> let us ſo medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and pauſe upon them, as to ſhun thoſe things which are threatned with the ſecond Death. Therefore, Beloved, <hi>ſince ye know theſe things, beware, leſt ye fall from your ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whom, with the Father, and ever Bleſſed Spirit, be given all Honour, Praiſe, Thanksgiving, and Obedience, now, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
               <p>And beſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, ſo that they that would paſs from hence to you, cannot; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they paſs to us that would come from thence.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THis is the Anſwer to the <hi>Rich Man's foregoing Requeſt, That</hi> Abraham <hi>would ſend</hi> Lazarus <hi>with a drop of Water to cool his Tongue. Abraham</hi> gives him the Title of <hi>(Son,) either as he was lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from him, or as he was a Member of that Church, of which he was the Father,</hi> So he terms him, by way of Irony, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration, that he might <hi>Remember,</hi> as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102510:67"/>an addition of his miſery, how baſely he degenerated from the practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Father of the Faithful; the advantages and opportunities of being happy he neglected, and his folly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf with the bare denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being a Member of the Church of Chriſt. <q> Remember, that in the other life, thou enjoyedſt the upper and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Springs, hadſt all the comfortable Accommodations the World could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with; and in them all thy happineſs was fixed, thy heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were wholly taken up with the pomp and pride of Life, thou hadſt no regard to, nor value for the things of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world; thou hadſt neither reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for God, the Author and Giver of thy ſtore; nor common compaſſion for thy Fellow-Creatures, driven to poverty and extream want: Therefore art thou now tormented, a wretched, and pitileſs Object; Not becauſe of thy riches, but becauſe thou didſt not employ them to thoſe ends and purpoſes for the which they were beſtowed upon thee. <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whom thou deſireſt to cool thy Tongue, ſhall not bring thee the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe thou wert ſo ſtubborn and hard-hearted, to deny him the crumbs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102510:67"/>which fell from thy Table. He was poor and deſpicable, appeared like one forſaken, had neither Friends nor Wealth; but embracing ſuch a poor condition with patience and thankfulneſs, is now made amends for all, and enjoys all that can careſs his powers, all that can raviſh his heart, all that is good, lovely, and deſirable. But beſides, there is a great gulf fixed between you and us, that there is not a poſſibility for the Saints to come to you, nor for you to come to us, both ſtates are determined. </q> Thou therefore muſt endure hunger, and thirſt, and the other direful torments in Hell, without pity or ſuccour; and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> ſhall enjoy the ſweet and raviſhing entertainments of Heaven, without lett or hinderance, where no ſatiety ſhall ever render his fruition lothſom or tedious, no ſad circumſtances imbitter his delights, nor any temptation diſturb or moleſt him. <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art termented. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed; ſo that they that would paſs from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> From which words we are adviſed,</p>

            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>That it will be a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the miſery of the damned, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and recollect the former means and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they have been under for Salvation,</hi> if they have deſcended from godly Parents, or have been Members of the Church of Chriſt, initiated thereinto by Baptiſm, and have made an open acknowledgement of its Faith and Doctrines. <hi>Son</hi> ſays <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich Man, <hi>remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a great gulf fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> But to begin with the former of theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it will be a great aggravation of the miſery of the damned, to conſider and recollect the former means and advantages they have been under for Salvation,</hi> if they have deſcended from godly Parents, or have been Members of the Church of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102510:68"/>Chriſt, initiated thereinto by Baptiſm, and have made an open acknowledgment of its Faith and Doctrines. <hi>Son,</hi> ſays <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to the rich Man, <hi>remember, that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things.</hi> As I have already hinted, the <hi>interiour faculties,</hi> as well as the outward ſenſes, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and tormented; or otherwiſe Hell could not properly be termed a place wherein is the perfection of miſery; nor would wicked men be puniſhed according to their offences.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who are not viſibly vicious, and are probably in common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, moral and regular; but yet very unholy and untoward within, in their thoughts, recollections of memory, in their deſires, and more ſecret wiſhes; who fearing corporal puniſhments, or the loſs of a good reputation, or the frowns and ill will of Relations or Acquaintance, refrain from publick wickedneſſes. Our bleſſed Saviour tells us, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were ſuch a ſort of People, they were very exact as to their outward Morals, prayed devoutly, faſted frequently, gave alms cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, and went in a ſeparate guard, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the vulgar; ſo that if we were to judge of them by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal demonſtrations, we ſhould conclude
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102510:69"/>them the ſtricteſt Chriſtians; But the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus lets us know, that their ends and purpoſes were carnal and ſecular, and that all their Ceremonies were only Cloaks to conceal their <hi>covetouſneſs, ſelf-intereſt, pride, and luſtfulneſs.</hi> Now if this people were only to be judged for their Actions, they would be immortalized, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Saints. But the Scriptures inform us, that men ſhall be accountable for their <hi>Thoughts, Deſires, and Wiſhes, as well as for their Actions: Every ſecret thing ſhall be brought into Judgment,</hi> ſays the wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> Upon which account, men may appear innocent and harmleſs to the World; and yet ſtand guilty before God, by reaſon of their blaſphemous, revengeful, impure, unchaſt thoughts. With theſe they may affront God, abuſe the Saints, and in effect drag young Virgins to an Adulterous Bed; and therefore it is but reaſonable that they ſhould be puniſhed for them. Now having made it manifeſt that the <hi>interiour faculties,</hi> as well as the <hi>outward ſenſes,</hi> ſhall be tormented; we will go on, and conſider what they are, and particularly how, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſhall be perplexed. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, The <hi>[Underſtanding]</hi> that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102510:69"/>ſhall be tormented with the ſenſe of the loſs ſuſtained. <hi>A Celeſtial Paradiſe forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> a perpetual ſequeſtration from God, and in him from every created good; an eternal excluſion from that reſt and peace, which makes the Saints happy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their fruition joyous, and infinitely pleaſant. And as the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> ſhall ponder theſe things, ſo it ſhall be actuated by the apprehenſion of the preſent evils it ſuffers, and of thoſe it muſt unhappily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo to eternity; chained in Hell, <hi>faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unquenchable flames</hi> tormented by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, baited by the damned Crew, kept waking without intermiſſion of ſleep, which would abate the pains; <hi>every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a freſh inſtance of miſery, a new ſcene of Torment;</hi> and all this, as long as there is a God to inflict and puniſh. Doubtleſs this is a moſt exquiſite Torment, to be always followed with a quick ſenſe of the loſs of Heaven, and of the leaſt degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to exaggerate the evils preſent, and thoſe which muſt follow, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or end. We may perceive this by ſome likeneſs of things of this life; when a man diſcovers himſelf deprived of an Eſtate or Inheritance, bequeathed him by the Will of his Parents, or Relations, or Acquaintance, in what a turbulent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102510:70"/>are all his ſenſes? <hi>How does he fret and fume?</hi> ſo uneaſie and nettled, that food has loſt its nouriſhing faculty with him; a ſoft Bed, which reſteth the wearied bones, and lulls a man into a refreſhing ſlumber, is irkſom and tedious to him. He ſighs, and pauzes upon his unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hap; and it may be, by an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſing, falls into a frenzy, or deep melancholy, which preying upon his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in a ſhort time ſends him into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World before the time. <hi>Now if the ſenſe of the loſs of finite and limited goods, doth ſo much grieve the heart, and makes a man his own unhappineſs;</hi> how much more will the ſenſe of the loſs of infinite and unlimited goods gall and torment, and gnaw upon the interiour faculties? <hi>An eternal loſs, cannot but produce an eternal ſenſe of it,</hi> eſpecially if it be the greateſt good; becauſe the greateſt evil is always preſent; the feeling of the latter revives the recognition of the former, whereby the ſenſe of what is laſt is much enhanced and aggravated. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Intellectual Memory,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we record things, and make thoſe as preſent, which were long ago committed. This ſhall be tormented with a perpetual recordation of the many opportunities
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102510:70"/>and advantages for Heaven, which have been fooliſhly contemned and neglected. The folly and vanity of thoſe things which were preferred before the <hi>glories and felicities of the other happy World.</hi> Then ſhall be ſadly brought to remembrance, the happy priviledge of <hi>a liberal Education, the encouragement and example of pious and holy Parents, the grave and wholeſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God's Miniſters, the advantage of reading the Holy Bible, and other religious Books, and imitating the vertuous Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Saints:</hi> All theſe priviledges and fair opportunities wholly diſregarded, for the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a moment, if compared with a long Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which follows. Thus ſhall the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Damned be multiplied, by recollecting the <hi>Ways and Means</hi> they uſed to deprive themſelves of the Inheritance of Heaven, to which they might have had right, if they had not diſinherited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When a Son, by his extravagant courſes, and repeated acts of diſobedience, has incenſed his Father againſt him, that he daſhes him out of his Will, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes him from the enjoyment of his eſtate after death, to which he might have had a filial propriety; when he feels the deprivation of the goods, ſuffers the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102510:71"/>and ſhame of a diſinherited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, and undergoes the infamy and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of a Caſt-off; how is he enraged againſt himſelf, for his folly in violating the eaſie Commands, and refuſing the good Counſels of his tender and indulgent Father, and thereby forfeited his good Will, and his right to his appurtenances? He that might have lived in repute and faſhion, is now the <hi>ridicule and common talk of his Acquaintance,</hi> and forced to be content with the meaneſt Treatments. And how much more will it torment and grieve the <hi>Damned in Hell,</hi> when it ſhall be brought to their remembrances, what a <hi>gracious Father God was once unto them, how he intreated, counſelled, and perſuaded them to be happy;</hi> what reaſonable, eaſie, and fair Commands, he impoſed upon them, and what a large Inheritance he entailed upon them, if they had been obedient; how long he bore with their inſolent carriage and diſingenuous deportment, how ready to paſs by the injuries offered to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, <hi>promiſing them pardon and a free forgiveneſs,</hi> if they would change their manners, and become more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the time to come; but were not wrought upon by his impunity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, ſlighting his love, abuſing his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102510:71"/>gracious tenderneſs, and <hi>ſetting the loweſt value upon his rich and glorious Promiſes:</hi> And now his patience is turned into fury, his indulgence into vengeance; and they, who once were <hi>Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, are become Slaves to the Devil, and the Puniſhments of Hell, to which they muſt pay as many Tributes, as they have ſenſes, powers, and members. What Scenes and Images of Terrour will ſuch an unhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordation preſent to the Damned! The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative faculty, the appetites, and the will, all the interiour powers and rational powers, ſhall be diſtinctly, and eternally perplexed, according to their capacity</hi> And thus much for the firſt thing deducible from the words of the Text, namely, <hi>That it will be a great aggravation of the miſery of the Damned, to conſider and recollect the former means and advantages they have been under for Salvation.</hi> I proceed from hence to the ſecond General thing, namely,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That there is no commerce or intercourſe between glorified and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Between us and you,</hi> ſays <hi>Abraham, there is a great Gulf fixed; ſo that they that would come from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> It is rendred in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a great Gulf, Quagmire, or Deſcent,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102510:72"/>ſo difficult and deep, that an attempt to paſs it would be to no purpoſe. It is thus expreſſed, to ſhew the <hi>impoſſibility of the glorified Saints bringing any comfort to the Damned, or of their being releaſed one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute from their pains.</hi> Both <hi>States are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and irreverſible; Heaven ſhall be perfect bliſs, and Hell perfect miſery.</hi> They in Heaven, ſhall not have their Joys ſowred and interrupted, by hearing the doleful complaints, terrible out-cries, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſcreeches, blaſphemies and curſes, by ſeeing the bodies of the damned <hi>inveloped in flames, their Tongues parched, their Throats ſcalded with ſlaming brimſtone, and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſeries they endure:</hi> Neither ſhall thoſe curſed Wretches have the happineſs to ſee the <hi>State and Grandeur of the Saints, nor to hear thoſe melodious noiſes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Hallelujahs, which they make, and ſing to the Lamb that ſits upon the Throne. They ſhall be locked up among the Devils, with the Key of Eternity, and ſhall for ever weep, and wail and gnaſh their teeth.</hi> It would in ſome meaſure aſlwage their afflictions, could they be permitted to feaſt their eyes with the <hi>Glory, Order, and Aeconomy of Heaven; the Luſtre and Beauty of that place of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> would ſwallow them up in wonder &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and make them, if I may ſo ſay,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102510:72"/>forget their lamentable Circumſtances.</hi> We know what a comfortable thing it is in affliction, to be careſſed with Friendly viſits, and entertained with ſome chearing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; how ſoon does the extremity of our maladies abate, and what a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do we quickly perceive, till the Friends be gone, and we unhappily left to thought and fancy. But in Hell are no viciſitudes of good and evil, no mixture or allay, no harmleſs pleaſure to divert the pain one moment; no commerce or intercourſe with Holy Angels, and Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Spirits; nothing that can be termed a good; but all that is evil, and inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſo; <hi>In Gehenna eſt omnium malorum complicatio,</hi> ſays one; In the priſon of Hell there is a complication of all evils; nor will they be the more tolerable, or wear off by time, or change their nature, becauſe God, who is the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the greateſt good, and in whom all other created goods concenter, will be eternally abſent from Hell. But here it may chance to be asked; that conſidering <hi>the humane Creature is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and temporary, and that all which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him is ſo, how can it ſtand with the juſtice of Almighty God, whoſe will is the Rule of Juſtice and Equity, who alſo is the ſource and fountain of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102510:73"/>that there ſhould be ſuch a diſproportion between the offence and the puniſhment, as to puniſh his poor, frail, finite Creature, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternal torment?</hi> To this I anſwer, that though humane tranſgreſſions are finite, yet they are committed againſt an infinite Majeſty; and had the ſinner who committed them, lived eternally, he would have ſinned eternally. Beſides, God having reſerved endleſs rewards for temporary vertue, promiſed all that he has, all that he can give, and all that he himſelf enjoys; it is but juſt, that the wilful forfeiture thereof ſhould be puniſhed with eternal torments. And hereupon, as one obſerves, the pain of loſs will be more rigorous and bitter, than all the reſt, becauſe the loſs of Heaven is the foundation and cauſe of all the other infernal puniſhments.</p>
            <p>What groſs ſtupidity then poſſeſſes men! who, for temporary pleaſures, for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a fooliſh luſt, will run the hazard of an infinite loſs, even God! <hi>To forfeit him, is to bid adieu to all that is good and deſirable.</hi> Are theſe fading delights ſo charming and great, as to content them to be baniſhed for ever from him who is the very ſource and ſea of happineſs? Were thoſe unhappy Souls beneath, who know and feel the pain of loſs, admitted to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102510:73"/>their Bodies, and live a time of tryal again; <hi>how tranſported with joy would they be, that they were put into a condition of regaining their loſs? They would generouſly deny a temptation to ſin, be careful in their choice, conſider well before they act, and look upon all theſe earthly entertainments as vain, empty, and worthleſs things.</hi> Their main em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy and ſollicitude, would be to prepare their Souls for Heaven; they would ſpend the time of their ſojourning here in fear, &amp; daily exerciſe themſelves to have a <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence, towards God, and towards Men.</hi> What a happineſs then do we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? that ſtill we are in a ſtate of hope, and, if not wanting to our ſelves, may commence an eternity with God, and all the Hoſt of Heaven. It will be but a ſad conſideration, that after we have lived our time under the <hi>ſound of the Goſpel,</hi> have enjoyed the means of Grace, and all other advantages, and opportunities of Salvation; that when we come to dye, we forrowfully diſcover, that we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the better for theſe mighty helps, not a whit qualified for the enjoyment of God no more, than if we never heard of a Goſpel, or Jeſus Chriſt. Then it will enrage us againſt our ſelves, that from the hopes of Heaven, we have precipitated our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102510:74"/>a deſparate ſtate; and for the gratification of a fooliſh luſt, have plunged our ſelves into the Ocean of miſery It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary, that now I proceed, in the laſt place, to draw ſome Practical Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from what has been ſaid, and then cloſe my Diſcourſe. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Will it be a great aggravation of the miſery of the damned, to conſider, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the former means and advantages they have been under for Salvation,</hi> if they have deſcended from godly Parents, or have been Members of the Church of Chriſt, initiated thereinto by Baptiſm, and have made an open acknowledgment of its Faith and Doctrines? let then the conſideration of this warn us from ſlighting, miſ-uſing and neglecting theſe priviledges and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py advantages; and lay a neceſſity upon us, to joyn our own endeavours with theſe means, that they may be a favour of life to us. Neither the eminence of a fair and ingenuous Education, nor the honour of being a Member of the Chriſtian Church, nor an open acknowledgment of its Inſtitutions, will be of any avail, unleſs they work together, by our own ſtudious induſtry, to the reforming of our lives, correcting of our ruder paſſions, and the reducing us to the evenneſſes of vertue,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102510:74"/>and a good diſpoſition. Doubtleſs there are a great many in the Regions of deſpair and ſorrow, who had godly Parents, and the advantage of a liberal Education, were baptized into the Church of Chriſt, and made an ample profeſſion of its Doctrines and Truths. Their torment is ſo far from being leſſened, becauſe of theſe priviledges, that it is infinitely enhaunced and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; as ſadly remembring how happy they might have been, what means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are quite loſt and thrown away upon them. It will not ſo much be the enquiry in the day of Judgment, whether we were baptized, as whether we have lived up to the Rule of God's word. He is not a <hi>Jew,</hi> who is one outwardly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a <hi>Jew,</hi> which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the letter, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. Thou mayeſt go down into Hell with the water of baptiſm in thy fore-head, with the name of God in thy mouth: for he is not affected with the ceremonial, without the internal part of Religion; Bodily worſhip, ſeparate from the concurrence of the heart, he terms, Impudent and bare-faced Hypocriſie, as he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102510:75"/>ſpeaks concerning the Oral Worſhip of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8, 9. <hi>This people draweth nigh unto me with their Mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me, and in vain do they worſhip me. Tho' thou ſpeakeſt with the tongue of Men and Angels; though thou haſt the gift of Prophecy, and underſtandeſt all Myſteries, and all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and though thou hadſt all Faith, ſo that thou couldſt remove Mountains; though thou beſtowedst all thy goods to feed the poor, and though thou giveſt thy body to be burned, yet if thou doeſt not truly love God, if thou art not conformable in Will and Affection to his Will and Law; all this will profit thee nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It muſt be a renewed mind, eſtranged from the luſts and vanities of the world, a new birth, a life of grace and faith, that will intitle us Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and qualifie us for the ſociety of Angels and beatified Spirits.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>And is there no commerce or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between glorified and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</hi> The conſideration of this ſhould engage us to honour, eſteem, reverence, and kindly treat the Saints of God in this life. To love them for their piety, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them for their example, to be thankful to them for the many devout prayers they put up to God for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102510:75"/>and Salvation, to vindicate and juſtifie them, againſt all the cavils, ſlanders, and reproaches, of unreaſonable and heady Men. How do they evidence their reſpect to us, in faſting, and praying, in weeping, and ſighing, and expoſtulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, to avert his Judgments we deſerve, and bleſs us by pardoning of our ſins, and crowning us with Glory hereafter? Let not a good man's pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be a motion to contemn him; for though he want the Accommodations of this life, yet he is a choſen Heir to the Kingdom of Heaven; and remember the good Offices he daily does for us. <hi>If he be hungry, feed him; if he be thirſty, give him drink; if he be naked, cloath him; if he be ſick, miniſter to his infirmity; if in priſon, viſit him with comfortable refreſhment: For he that giveth to drink, to one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward,</hi> Matth. 10.42.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad conſideration, that goodneſs ſhall not be preferred before riches, that wealth muſt take place before piety. What will that avail thee, when thou art bidding adieu to the pleaſures of earth, and preparing to make thy perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before the Judgment-ſeat of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102510:76"/>Chriſt? Thou muſt bring nothing there but thy vertues, or thy vices; the Judge is no reſpecter of perſons; If thou be condemned, there is nothing to prevent the execution of that irreverſible ſentence, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Poverty is hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, becauſe Chriſt our Head choſe to be poor; and to deſpiſe that, is to fling dirt into his face, and reproach him from whom we expect eternal life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how mean ſoever the Servants of God appear in this World, how ſcanty ſoever their portion be; let us reſpect them, and do them all the kind Offices we can; then, at the laſt and final reckoning, they will appear for us, and declare the ſpecial acts of civility, the tender, compaſſionate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices we have done them, the reſpect and fingular regard we had for them, and the generous treatments we exerciſe towards them; then, in the face of the whole world, ſhall the Judge pronounce, <hi>Come ye bleſſed Children of my Father, receive a Kingdom, prepared for you from the foundation of the World: For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was naked, and ye cloathed me; I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ye took me in; I was ſick and in priſon, and ye came unto me; for as much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102510:76"/>as ye have done it unto the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, and Finally,</hi> We knowing the terrours of the Lord, let us be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to conſider our preſent State, to be perfectly acquainted with our ſelves, how we have ſpent the former part of our lives, whether in Gods Service, or the Devils Drudgery; and if, upon an impartial ſurvey, we diſcover that we have hitherto erred from the right end of our Creation, humbly to implore Gods pardon, and to beg his grace for the time to come, that joyning our own endeavours with it, we may redeem the time we have loſt, by breaking off our ſins, and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applying our ſelves to the practice of true Religion.</p>
            <p>It is very ſad to continue in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, becauſe we know not how ſoon it will be ere we be ſtrip'd into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Spirits, and ſent into an irreverſible ſtate. And to be thus ſurprized, and the Work of our Souls left unwrought, would be the worſt of evils; and then what would we give, if poſſible, that we might have again ſuch opportunities and advantages of being happy? conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore in time, repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in this life of tryal, ſhake off that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102510:77"/>impovidence which detaineth you, <hi>make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit;</hi> mortifie and ſubdue your unruly will, wean your affections from the pride of life; manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny <hi>all ungodlineſs, and wordly luſts, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world; looking for, without wavering, the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May God grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his ſpirit in the inner man; that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith; that you, being rooted and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the height, breadth, length and depth, and to know the love of Chriſt, that ye may be filled with all the fullneſs of God. Now unto the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>wiſe God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, be given the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>

Let him tell them how I curſe my Folly, for living ſecure and careleſs, without thought of another World, or what would become of me after death. Let him aſſert my Reſolution, That if I was admitted to re-enter the World, and live my Days over again that are paſt, I would not be charmed with the flatteries of Luſt and Senſuality; nor ſpending my time in eating, drinking, and ſoft delights; in cloathing my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with gawdy Raiment, nor bend my ſtudy to invent Recreations for my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. I would limit my Will, Deſires, and Affections; and by a prudent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement bring my Fleſh under, that it might be corrective and govern'd by the inſinuations of Reaſon. I would ſet an ineſtimable value upon the means of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102510:78"/>Salvation, which I fooliſhly ſlighted, and turned into wantonneſs. <hi>That I would live in a conſtant expectation of Death and Judgment.</hi> Such a Relation as this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham,</hi> would aſtoniſh my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſcare them from their Sins, and caution them againſt thoſe Imprudences, which were my deſtruction, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs ruine.

But to the Anſwer which <hi>Abraham</hi> makes to the rich Man's Petition; <q> Thy Brethren have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, thoſe exact Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of God's Will, their Manuſcripts are Truths delivered by the Holy Ghoſt; and therein is dictated whatſoever God exacts from Men, and Directions how they may pleaſe their Creator. He will not grant Men needleſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Revelations, to gratifie their vain Curioſity; ſince he has acquainted them with every thing that is fit for them to know and practiſe. Thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren cannot plead Ignorance, when they are daily excited and admoniſhed by God's Ambaſſadors: And if they will not be reformed by theſe Means, and mighty Helps, they cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect that God ſhould ſend <hi>departed Souls with a ſpecial Commiſſion,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to accept of the Terms of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, againſt their will. <hi>His Word is ſufficient to prepare them for Heaven,</hi> if they will but believe its Propoſitions, and live up to the Rule of Life preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed therein.

               <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, <hi>That the Scriptures are the only means appointed by God, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, Converſion, and Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Abraham</hi> argues the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impertinence of the <hi>Rich Man's requeſt, that he would diſmiſs</hi> Lazarus <hi>to his Brethren,</hi> by urging the advantages and fair opportunities they had of making themſelves for ever; <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> There is no need of extraordinary revelations, ſince they have ſuch an eminent privilege of hearing the Counſels and Inſtructions of thoſe worthy Men, commiſſioned by, and imployed under God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it is too plain an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great Infidelity, and hardneſs of Heart, when the Word of God doth not take place, convince Men of their ſins, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily bring them from under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God.</hi> I ſhall treat of both theſe diſtinctly, beginning with the former.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Scriptures are the only means appointed by God, for the Conviction, Converſion, and the Salvation of Sinners,</hi> drawn from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s anſwer to the Rich
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102510:81"/>Man's Petition, that he would <hi>ſend</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>away, with a ſpecial Commiſſion, to his ſurviving Brethren:</hi> No, they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, let them hear them. The Word of God is a Declaration of his Will concerning Mankind, who, deſiring their eternal Good, hath, by <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> ſent, and commiſſioned after him, preſcribed the Methods, in a plain and familiar manner, to be uſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, to that end. He therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts his Prerogative, and the <hi>undeniable claim he has to our Worſhip,</hi> and the beſt of our Services, as the <hi>Lord our God, the Contriver and Builder of the Univerſe; our Creator, who breathed into us the breath of Life, and we became living Souls.</hi> And to ſtrengthen the belief of thoſe Truths writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and diſperſed, by his choſen Servants, graciouſly condeſcended to come down from Heaven, <hi>eclipſed with Humanity, and ſupplied the defects of his Laws delivered in the Minority of the World: And leſt by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeeming alterations, the Jews, with whom he chiefly converſed, ſhould ſtagger in the belief of the</hi> Moſaical <hi>Traditions, tells them,</hi> Matth. 5.17. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy, but to fullfil;</hi> more emphatically, to reveal the full intent and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102510:81"/>meaning of the Law anciently delivered, that Men may be put out of ſcruple and doubt concerning their Duty, and the terms upon which their Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to create a ſeparate veneration and high eſteem for <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> gives an excellent Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and pathetick Encomium of it, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>It is profitable,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> That is, the holy Scriptures, termed the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably profitable to inſtruct us in the belief of thoſe Propoſitions abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, to convince us of any truth which conſiſts with our happineſs; or of any ſin, the allowed practice of which will ſink us into the Abyſs of Miſery; to correct us when ſtraying, to ſhew us the right path, and to bring us to rights; <hi>to inſtruct us in that righteouſneſs, in which we muſt appear before God,</hi> to the end that Chriſtians may be as perfect in this frail ſtate, as they can be aptly prepared to every good work, commendable and praiſe-worthy in the ſight of God. And in the 15th Verſe he urges, <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102510:82"/>through faith, which is</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> they have ſufficiency of Doctrine, to make us wiſe enough to get to Heaven, if we have a genuine Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, receiving him as our Saviour, and a Faith aſſenting and agreeing to theſe holy Writings, as the revelation of the Divine Will. So that it is fond flattery, for Men to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> as if they were only Human Inventions, compoſed and written in a melancholy ſtudious humour, or by ſtrength of fancy, and expect extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelations to convince and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them; as <hi>an Angel from above, cloathed with the brightneſs of glory, with a ſpecial Commiſſion in his Hand, to make them believe that there is a Heaven; and a damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from beneath, with the woful marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance upon him, wringing his hands, tearing his hair, gnaſhing his teeth, and telling them what terrible preparations God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for impenitent ſinners, to beget in them the belief of a Hell.</hi> God is not obliged to convert Men after ſuch an extraordinary manner; nor, indeed, is it reaſonable he ſhould, ſince he has revealed his mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mankind to his <hi>Servant</hi> Moſes, <hi>and to the Prophets after him,</hi> and confirmed the ſame by his <hi>Son, working mighty Miracles, and aſtoniſhing Wonders;</hi> and by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102510:82"/>to the Apoſtles, who converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, convinced them of their errors, and fixed them in the profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by them handed down to us. <hi>Wherefore ſhould God detract from the power, authority, and truth of his holy Word, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Men after a ſtrange and unuſual courſe?</hi> The nice and ſtubborn <hi>Phariſees,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe numberleſs Miracles which our Saviour wrought in their view, to poſſeſs them with the belief of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and that he had his Commiſſion from God the Father, <hi>impertinently required a ſign from him,</hi> ſomething extraordinary, more than he had already done, expecting that ſuch a Miſſion ſhould be ſo confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Either, perhaps, that he would alter the courſe of the Sun, or make it ſtand ſtill, as it did upon the Dial of</hi> Ahaz; <hi>or, that he would demand a Guard of Angels from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who ſhould teſtifie his Authority, and that he was no Impoſtor, as they prophanely ſuſpected; or, it may be, that he would cauſe a Voice from Heaven to thunder in their Ears,</hi> that he was the Son of God, and threaten them with Damnation if they diſputed the Truth of it. To this our bleſſed Lord anſwers, <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation ſeeketh after a Sign, but there ſhall no Sign be given them. I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102510:83"/>have wrought Miracles enough to convince them, if they were not harder than the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt Mill-ſtone. I filled five thouſand Perſons with five Loaves and two Fiſhes; and of the fragments thereof remained twelve Baskets full. I raiſed</hi> Lazarus <hi>to life, who had been dead four days. With a word I have caſt out Devils, out of thoſe who were poſſeſſed; opened the Eyes of thoſe who were born blind: A Woman that had an Iſſue of Blood twelve years, and had ſpent all her Subſtance with Phyſicians for cure, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made whole by touching the hem of my Garment. The Lame and Paralitick are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to Health and Strength by me, without medicinal Applications. The Widows Son of</hi> Nain, <hi>who was carrying forth in order to be buried, received life again by my command, Ariſe.</hi> Abundance <hi>more Miracles of this kind I have wrought before you, O ye of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith, to convince you that I am ſent from God:</hi> But ſtill retaining Prejudice and Malice againſt me, whereby you are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and ſeared with Infidelity; there ſhall no other Sign be ſhewn, to ſatisfie your vain Curioſity; ſince enough has been done, to make impartial and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Minds believe, <hi>that I act by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power,</hi> and conſequently have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Commiſſion from God. To
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102510:83"/>run parallel, God having revealed his Will concerning Mankind, now called the <hi>Old and New Teſtament;</hi> the former relating to <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> who were choſen and peculiar Ambaſſadors, commiſſioned by, and immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed under God, to ſpread the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Laws, and to inſinuate with his Creatures to revere the Sanction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: The latter pertaining to the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> who was impowered and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his Father to perfect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge the intent and meaning of his Laws, that we might not be be-wildred in Fancies and Illuſions, <hi>grovel in the Dark, and periſh in Ignorance: If, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this</hi> Pharos, <hi>or great Illuminary, which would light and guide us to Heaven's Gates,</hi> we ſtill wander and ſtray from the Truth, expecting a miraculous Revelation, that God will convert us by ſome other means, which we have no warrant for, nor have the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe; we ſhall be groſly deceived, and obſtinately plunge our ſelves into remedileſs Ruine; <hi>he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appointed no other means for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, Converſion, and Salvation, than his Holy Word,</hi> which he has commiſſioned his Miniſters to preach and propagate. And thus much may ſuffice for the firſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102510:84"/>thing, which I propoſed to ſpeak to, namely, <hi>That the Word of God is the only Means appointed to convert and bring us to the enjoyment of him.</hi> Which is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Abraham</hi> urges to the rich Man, to excuſe the grant of his requeſt, <hi>That</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus <hi>might be ſent to his Brethren to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto them: No, they have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, the appointed means for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them give heed to them:</hi> It is but in vain for them to expect extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Revelations, and for you to deſire them. From hence I proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond general Thing, namely,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it is too plain an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſeared Heart, and ſtrong Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when the Word of God doth not take place, convince Men of their Sins, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily bring them from under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, unto God.</hi> And this <hi>Abraham</hi> implies in his Anſwer to the rich Man; <hi>Thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, who are ſufficient to reclaim, and work a reformation in them, unleſs their Heart be like an</hi> Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, <hi>ſtubborn and impenetrable:</hi> For their Commiſſion is immediately from God, and that which they preach, is by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inſpiration. St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>That the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102510:84"/>Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit;</hi> that is, it is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and influential, of mighty force and ſagacity, active and ſearching. Now it evidently follows, that Men muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly hardened, and arrived to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high pitch of Infidelity, when this quickening and converting Word of God loſeth its Vertue, and ſeems no more than an idle Tale to them. For no more it is in effect, while Men continue in ſin, and live ſecure and thoughtleſs, under the ſound and preaching of it. The <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who had but a ſmall ſenſe of God, as he was journying, accidentally pitching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. where he read; <hi>He was led as a Sheep to the ſlaughter; and like a Lamb dumb before his Shearers; ſo he opened not his Mouth: In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away, and who ſhall declare his generation? For his life is taken from the Earth,</hi> Being affected with the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, asketh <hi>Philip</hi> of whom the Prophet ſpake? <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, Of Jeſus; and preaching him to him, and the neceſſity of being admitted into his Fold; he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large Pool, ſaith, <hi>What doth hinder me to be baptized? And</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, If thou believeſt thou maiſt: He anſwered, I do believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102510:85"/>was immediately baptized,</hi> Acts 8. from 30, to 39. Of ſuch Force and Energy is the Word of God, when it is read with Care, heard with Attention, and received into a flexible and unprejudiced Heart. While St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Expounding, and preaching the Scriptures, about <hi>three thouſand Souls at once were converted from Judaiſin, and made eminent Proſelites of the holy Jeſus,</hi> Acts 2.41. While St. <hi>Paul</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Felix</hi> the Governor, concerning <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come;</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>he fell a trembling, Acts</hi> 24.25. The Word preached, <hi>ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the bottom,</hi> and filled him with a ſenſe of his own guilt; it dictated to him that he was the Man, tho' his own perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs defeated its healing Operation upon him. It is Mens infidelity and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, which they have contracted by cuſtomary ſinning, which choaks the Word, that it becometh unfruitful. Or otherwiſe, could they read and hear God ſpeaking to them to break off their Sins, and exert new and vertuous Habits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching and intreating them to be wiſe for themſelves; that God, who can every moment, by an inviſible and irreſiſtable Power, revenge himſelf on diſobedient Man, <hi>and ſend him roaring into the infernal
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102510:85"/>Pit;</hi> I ſay, could Men live under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſound of the Word of God, and yet remain unconvinced and unaffected, unleſs they were <hi>ſeared againſt Reproof, and impregnable to good Advice;</hi> did a Man abſolutely, without any reſerve, believe that God will certainly puniſh all proud Contemners of his Laws; that his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, without any reſpect of Perſons, will be executed upon every one that ſhall be found in Rebellion againſt him; would he, think you, dare to love his Sins, and ſpend his time in vain Sports and Paſtimes? Would he not rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bethink himſelf, change his mind, and reſolve to be conformable, in Action, and Affection, to the Word of Truth? Did a Man fear God, as he ought, which implies a belief in him in the conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures; he would dread his diſpleaſure, and prudently withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thoſe Vices which will incur it. <hi>As a Man fears thee, ſo is thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſalm 90.11. Or, more plainly, according as Mens Thoughts are of God, ſo are their Lives. And from hence we may, without being cenſured as uncharitable, conclude, whether Men revere or contemn God, by the general courſe of their Actions. It is an ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102510:86"/>Argument of a profound love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and fear of God, when a Man makes the <hi>Scripture his Rule;</hi> when he avoids thoſe things it interdicts, and chearfully doth thoſe it commands As on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when Men <hi>Swear, blaſpheme God, and and his Religion, Cheat, Oppreſs, Lye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, and the like,</hi> and allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein, with delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: This is Proof, beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that God is not in all their Thoughts, that his Word is as a Cypher; that they either conclude him a Being, which does not diſturb himſelf by taking cognizance of Things committed here below; or, if he does, yet will not be ſo rigid to call them to Account; and thus give themſelves encouragement to follow their own Inventions, <hi>and to ſin without Concern or Thought:</hi> And when once Men are deaf to the Calls of the Goſpel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe its Promiſes, and contemn its Threatnings; when neither <hi>Moſes, nor the Prophets, nor Chriſt Jeſus, nor his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,</hi> can work upon them to renounce their Impieties, and to order their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as becomes Chriſtians; I ſay, if theſe mighty Helps prove ineffectual, it is is to be reaſonably preſumed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides, <hi>no, not an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102510:86"/>nor a damned Spirit from beneath, could ever reach, or have any influence upon them.</hi> And thus much for the ſecond Thng, namely, <hi>That it is too great an Argument of a ſeared Heart, and ſtrong Infidelity, when the Word of God doth not take place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of their Sins, and happily bring them from under the power of Satan, unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I proceed to draw ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from the whole, and ſo conclude. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We learn what a mighty Privilege and Advantage we are partakers of, that Almighty God ſhould honour us, ſinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with the declaration of his Will, the which is a guide to conduct us through cragged and uneven ways, a glaſs to diſcover our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſpots and ſtains upon our Souls, that we may wipe them out by repentance, and a new life, and a Lamp to light us to Heaven:</hi> We might ſtill have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered with fooliſh fancies, and groſs illuſions, have followed the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of our heady Minds, and run violently into the Ocean of Miſery, if God, who careth for us, and highly values our good, had not ſet out this <hi>great illuminary, his Word,</hi> to bring us back, and call us from the deſtruction we were ignorantly poſting to.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102510:87"/>
               <hi>What an eſteem and veneration ought we to have then for the Scriptures?</hi> How dear ſhould they be to us? We cannot read and meditate on them too often, <hi>we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too wiſe for Heaven,</hi> nor too much acquainted with our ſelves. <hi>Our ſelves are a great Myſtery,</hi> which requires a good Judgment, a diſcerning Spirit, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Mind, to comprehend; and the Scriputres mightily help us in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelves; by them, as one of the Fathers has it, all Men may be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>the weak ſtrengthened, and the ſtrong confirmed;</hi> ſo that ſurely there are none, who are enemies to the reading of God's Word, but ſuch as either be ſo ignorant, that they know not how wholſom and ſalviſick it is, or elſe be ſo ſick, that they loath and ſtomach at the moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and adapt Medicines to heal their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; or ſo ungodly, that they would with all perſons might continue in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and groſs ignorance of God and themſelves. It is a lamentable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the <hi>Bible, which treateth of Mens ſalvation, and teacheth them how they may make ſure of Heaven,</hi> ſhould be ſo much ſlighted as it is; that <hi>Novels, Romantick, Hiſicries, and Pedantick Poetry,</hi> all but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wit and Invention, ſhould be read
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102510:87"/>with ſuch attention and curioſity, with an eager appetite, and a well-pleaſed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>and the Word of God, which hath brought light and immortality into the World, hurried over, and ſlovenly peruſed, as if it were a dull, ſapleſs, and heavy compoſition, not worth Mens while to carry in their memories.</hi> It will turn to a diſmal after-reckoning, when God ſhall judge the contemners and deſpiſers of his <hi>Oracles;</hi> when they ſhall be tried by that Word, which now they diſdain; and the threatnings therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, which now they laugh at, ſhall be put in full execution; better they had never heard of a Goſpel, or a Jeſus Chriſt; better they had lived in ſome dark corner of the earth, <hi>where the Sun of righteouſneſs never ſhined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>If we hope and wiſh for the continuance of God's Word among us, if we would that it may be a ſavour of life unto life to us; in fine, if we would have that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherein we muſt ſtand before the Son of Man, when he comes attended with his mighty Angels to judge the World, and to determine every Mans final ſtate, then it highly concerns us to put a ſeparate value upon the Scriptures, to read them as the Oracles of God, to believe them as the contents of his Will concerning us, and to order our Lives and Converſations
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102510:88"/>according as they direct us. To revere them, as they bring the glad tidings of Salvation, and to admire them as they contain wonderful expreſſions of the Divine Love to us.</hi> They inſtruct us how to behave our ſelves in all conditions of Life. If we are rich, they counſel us to be humble, meek, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending; to be indifferently affected with our Wealth, that we may not be too much incumbered with cares, fears, and uneaſie jealouſies, which diſturb the Mind, diſtract the Thoughts, and make Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>If we be poor, the Bible even improves and ſweetens an adverſe ſtate,</hi> by counſelling us to caſt all our care upon God, who careth for us, to put our confidence in him; to preſent our Pravers to him, who, if he grant not thoſe things we pray for, yet ſome other he knows moſt ſuitable and convenient for us, and at laſt will reward us with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of his Kingdom, for our faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and continuing in well-doing.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>the Bible has a Salve for every Sore, Medicaments of all ſorts;</hi> it cures blindneſs of Heart, weakneſs of Judgment, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of Faith, and makes a Chriſtian ſuch a one as God would have him to be. <hi>Is then this Book to be ſlighted, and thrown
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102510:88"/>by as uſeleſs?</hi> Can Men be unwilling to peruſe and meditate upon it, or think their time ill ſpent in reading it? Can they be better imployed than in acquainting themſelves with God's Will, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how they may fullfil it? How they may paſs through this troubleſom and vexatious World blameleſs, that they may commence a happy and bleſſed Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? <hi>What can be compared with the Soul?</hi> And what loſs ſo irreparable as the loſs of it? Inſomuch that our Saviour ſays, What will it avail a Man, if he had the Worlds wealth, every thing that is great, good, and deſirable in it, and loſe his Soul? All that he has cannot make him ſatisfaction, or repair his damage. What therefore ſhould be every Mans ſtudy ſo much, as to provide for the after ſtate of his Soul, to read and ponder the ways and means he muſt uſe to prepare his Soul for the embraces of the Father of Spirits? <hi>How melancholy ſoever Men may think it is, to fill their Minds with the thoughts of Death, Judgment, and Eternity, yet when they come to die, they will earneſtly wiſh themſelves well provided for their Voyage into another World. Let them therefore loſe no time in health, but read diligently, meditate ſeriouſly, and practiſe conſcionably, the Word of God;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102510:89"/>which, by Divine Grace, and their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, will make them wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, and to conclude; As we are Chriſtians, let us have a ſpecial regard to God's Word, and, with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>hide it in our hearts,</hi> that we may not ſin againſt our Maker. Let it be our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, our Guide, and Director,</hi> that all our Actions, Words and Thoughts, may be pure and blameleſs. And that we may thus order our ſteps, let us pray as our Church: <hi>O Bleſſed Lord, who haſt cauſed all Holy Scriptures to be written for our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grant that we may in ſuch-wiſe hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digeſt them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy Word, we may embrace, and ever hold faſt the bleſſed hope of everlaſting Life, which thou haſt given us in thy Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> to whom, with the Father, and the ever Bleſſed Spirit, be given all Honour, Praiſe, Thankſgiving, and Obedience, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <hi>Amend.</hi>

               <p>And he ſaid, Nay, Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
               <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THE Rich Man ſtill purſues his <hi>Requeſt,</hi> not being ſatisfied with that anſwer <hi>Abraham</hi> made him; If one whom my Brethren <hi>knew was dead,</hi> ſhould appear, and ſpeak to them, giving them a Relation, that he ſaw their Friend in a very miſerable and afflicted State, covered with unquenchable flames, from the head unto the foot; and that if they did not reform, and take up, they muſt certainly undergo the like torments: This would be an irreſiſtable argument,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102510:90"/>and have ſuch a powerful effect upon them, that they would preſently bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, change their lives, and throughly repent of their paſt miſ-ſpent time. The ſlight, and hollow ſpeech of a Ghoſt would fright them into better manners, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly convince them. To this <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>If thy Brethren hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi> If the ſtanding Revelation of God, ſo well atteſted, be not ſufficient to confute them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and bring them to rights; in all probability, they would be as ſtubborn and inflexible, if God ſhould work a ſpecial miracle in order to their Converſion. As for inſtance, if he ſhould diſpatch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Soul, and charge it to teſtifie unto them, that if they will not forſake their debaucheries, and exert new and vertuous Habits, they ſhall certainly fall as ſo many Victims to his Vengeance. There is hardly any paſſage in Scripture, which more aſſerts the ſtubbornneſs and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of ſinners hearts, than this; nor any text that looks more diſmally upon perſons ſitting under the means of Grace, reading and hearing the word of God, and yet perceive not their hearts ſoftned, and brought to yield, by its quickening
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102510:90"/>and converting Power. It is a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable concluſion; that if the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which have brought many out of darkneſs and groſs ignorance, humbled many a perverſe, and molified many a ſeared heart, and fetched abundance of Strangers home to Chriſt Jeſus's fold; I ſay, if theſe convincing and influential means work not upon ſinners, to repent, believe, and live up to that expreſs holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they require; it is very much to be doubted, whether any <hi>extraordinary Revelations would ever effect or reach them. For though ſenſible demonſtration be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage imaginable, to moral perſuaſion;</hi> yet theſe things are under no Divine appointment to ſuch an effect. It is not ſo much to be wondred at, that the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſee their fellow-ſinners ſtruck ſuddenly dead by an <hi>inviſible hand,</hi> and yet unconcernedly drink to exceſs, and every day gratifie their luxurious and thirſty appetites with large and unlimitted draughts. That multitudes of ſinners are unexpectedly hurried into the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable world, and their Companions not in the leaſt affected with ſuch inſtances of Divine Vengeance; but obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in iniquity, as if there was no God to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102510:91"/>condemn, nor a Devil to puniſh them. What can awake and rouze Men out of the ſleep of ſin if ſuch ſenſible evidences as theſe, ſuch ſpecial demonſtrations of Gods fury, doth not alarm and ſtrike them with fear and trembling? but to the further proſecution of the Text; <hi>The rich Man ſaith to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Nay, but if one ment from the dead to my Brethren, they would repent.</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaith unto him, If they believe not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi> That which is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally propoſed to our conſideration from the words, is this, <hi>(Viz.) That if men give no heed to the written word of God, atteſted and confirmed by mighty miracles, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing nonders, if they are not perſuaded to quit their ſine to change their evil minds, and walk with care and circumſpection, by the Holy Scripture; in all probability they would not be Converted, if ſome mighty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was wrought, in order to their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> As for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>If a departed Soul was commiſſioned by God to appear to them.</hi> And this ſhall be the ſubject of my enſuing Diſcourſe to prove And in order to this, it is neceſſary to make out theſe two Things.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:102510:91"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the fixed Revelation of Gods Will, has more power and force to convince and reform men, than a ſingular, ſpecial mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, wrought to that purpoſe, can have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That ſhould God condeſcend to gratifie a wicked Man's vain curioſity, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one to riſe from the dead, and to teſtifie unto him, that the courſe he takes, without ſpeedy amendment, will be the eternal ruine of him, and that the preparations in Hell are very terrible and inſupportable; yet he will invent arguments, and propound reaſons, to fortifie himſelf, that he may not be affected with, and influenced by an ſuch apparition, and frightful Relation; as he heretofore did to withſtand the prevalent motives of Religion. If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi> I begin with the former of theſe two, namely,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the fixed Revelation of Gods Will, here in the Text, termed,</hi> Moſes and the Prophets, <hi>has more power and force, to convince and reform Men, than a ſingular, ſpecial miracle wrought to that purpoſe, can have.</hi> The leſs may be ſaid under this Head, becauſe I have very largely treated of the Scripture, as the only appointed means, for the Conviction, Converſion,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102510:92"/>and Salvation of ſinners, in my laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein I urged, that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and comprehenſive character, the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> has left upon record, of Gods Holy Word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>It is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> throughly furniſhed unto all good works, that is, it will, if good heed be given to it, make a Chriſtian as compleat, as poſſibly he can be in this life. As alſo that other moſt eloquent and affecting commendation, the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere expreſſes of the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>It is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword; piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, of the joynts and marrow; and is a dijcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Meaning in brief, That the word of God is ſo ſagacious and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is able to work a thorough Reformation in men; not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their outward Actions, and more viſible Morals, but with regard alſo to the I houghts and Purpoſes of their Hearts; making them Pure and Blameleſs, Holy and Innocent; that ſo men may be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prepared for Heaven, being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outwardly, but inwardly vertuous. But
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102510:92"/>that which I ſhall further urge for the proof of this Point, namely, That the ſtanding Revelation of Gods will, here called in the Text, <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> hath more power and force to convince and reform Men, than a ſingular, ſpecial miracle wrought to that purpoſe can have; is this; <hi>It is not only the appointed means, but God has ordained no other to reclaim men.</hi> He will not that they be convinced, ſo much by Senſe, as by Reaſon; not ſo much by Ocular Demonſtration, as Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Concluſions. And therefore it argues, that thoſe men, who are not won and brought over by the inſinuations of the Goſpel, <hi>but expect ſome extraordinary deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to convict them,</hi> are deſperately har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and muſt periſh without remedy. It would infinitely detract from the <hi>power and authority of Gods word,</hi> and render it inſignificant and invalid, if, when men out of a fond humour, and perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, refuſe to hearken to, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it, God ſhould <hi>deviate from the ordinary rule, by permitting Spectrums or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions to diſcourſe with, and perſuade them to break off their ſins by a timely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> His promiſes and threatnings would take but little effect, nay, men would ſcarce have Faith enough to believe them, if ſuch
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102510:93"/>extraordinary methods were commonly uſed to cure Men of their obſtinate blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and perverſe infidelity. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould God anſwer Mens vain curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity? Why ſhould he confute them of their Errours, by new and ſtrange means, when the truth of Chriſtianity hath been atteſted by <hi>wonders and miracles, by the blood of Martyrs, who died for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it and by the Converſion of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſince?</hi> It muſt be concluded, that they were weary of their lives, very ſoft, and eaſie, melancholly, fanciful Perſons, who would thus embrace death, relinquiſh their intereſts, goods, and poſſeſſions, for the ſake of the Truth, of which they had no apparent teſtimony. They muſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, <hi>the world has lain a long while in Ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Darkneſs, amuſed only with fictious Relations, and vain Genealogies;</hi> and that thoſe who died long ſince in the belief of the Scripture, are without hope; Or, otherwiſe how is it, that the <hi>Oracles of God</hi> are not more credited by them? Why are men ſo ſeared and impenitrable, that the <hi>word of God, which is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword,</hi> loſeth its Vertue, and its healing Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them quit defeated? And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:102510:93"/>
            <p>If God had diſcovered any inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his Holy Word, that it was not able to turn mens hearts; he would have uſed ſome other methods to that end, and not have permitted ſo many thouſands to have lived and dyed in their ſins, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever. He would not ſuffer poor Souls to run into the Labyrinth of Deſpair, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be hardened, if his word alone, which hath brought Life and Immortality into the world, was not capable, or had not ſufficiency of Doctrine, to inſtruct and guide them in the path that leads to Heaven: Nor would our bleſſed Saviour have pronounced ſuch terrible woes againſt the <hi>Unbelieving Jews,</hi> nor had Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence curſed them, who were once his peculiar People, a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſt-hood, as he did by ſcattering them all the world over, but no where incorporated into a Nation, a ſtanding and viſible mark of Vengeance upon them; I ſay, this people would not have been ſo ſeverely dealt with, upon the account of their <hi>infidelity; If the word preached by the Holy Jeſus, and confirmed by miracles and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual ſigns, was not convincing and influenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> Wherefore it is ſadly recorded of them, <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>That God hath blinded
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102510:94"/>their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with their heart and be converted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I draw this Concluſion, That when men arrive to ſuch a pitch of daring preſumption, as to give little or no heed to the written word of God; all other means uſed for their Converſion, ſuch as Preaching, friendly Counſel, and Admoniſhment, <hi>ſeldom affecteth, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a change in them.</hi> Hence a Friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh anothers Enemy, becauſe he tells him the truth, mildly reproves him for his ſin, ſorrowfully tells him what a deſperate condition he is in, and what he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect if he perſiſts and dies in an irrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſtate. By ſuch, <hi>Gods Miniſters,</hi> and their wholeſom Diſcourſes, are reproached; thoſe Sermons which they ſhould uſe as medicaments to heal their wounded Souls, are made their ſport and paſtime, fitting only to be Subjects of vain wit, and frothy drollery. It is a ſad preſage of final ruine, when the <hi>ſtanding Revelation of Gods Will doth not work upon men, to the changing of their manners and turning them from under the power of Satan, unto God. In all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability neither an Angel from Heaven, nor a damned Ghoſt from beneath, could ever reach and overcome them.</hi> For if that word,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102510:94"/>which was uſhered into the world with Thundrings and Lightnings, delivered by the Prophets by God's ſpecial Order and Inſpiration; and to ſtrengthen the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it, was rehearſed and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof might be univerſally ſpread, was delivered by the <hi>ſame Jeſus to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> and, that ſucceeding ages might not be brought up in ignorance, and live and dye without the knowledge of God, and their Duty, was <hi>handed down from the Apoſtles to Us;</hi> That word, that reformed three thouſand Souls at one time, <hi>Converted Heathens,</hi> who had no other ſenſe of their Maker, than what they received from the <hi>Book of Nature;</hi> and brought over multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to the Profeſſion and Practice of Chriſtianity, <hi>who never heard of it before.</hi> I ſay, if this word of God, which has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evidenced its power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and is the means of that Piety and Religion practiſed in our days, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men, their ſtubbornneſs and wilful infidelity, defeating its aptneſs and influence; we may very reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if a ſpecial <hi>miracle was wrought to convert them, it would be to no purpoſe.</hi> But here, notwithſtanding what has been already urged, ſome may yet ſay in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102510:95"/>Language of the Text, <hi>But if one roſe from the dead, we would repent.</hi> The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments of the Goſpel being ſtill, and the ſame, and which by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we find have not power enough to reclaim us: ſome new method uſed for our Converſion, as an <hi>Apparition or Ghoſt,</hi> would, above any thing elſe, perſuade us. Now how little this would affect them, I ſhall ſhew in the proſecution of the ſecond Point, which is,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That ſhould God condeſcend to gratifie a Wicked Mans vain Curioſity, by cauſing one to riſe from the dead, and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto him, that the courſe he takes, without ſpeedy amendment, will be the eternal ruine of him, and that the preparations in Hell are very terrible and inſupportable; yet he will invent Arguments, and propound Reaſons, to fortiſie himſelf that he may not be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and inſtuenced by ſuch an Apparition, and frightful Relation; as heretofore he did, to withſtand the prevalent Motives of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It is not to be diſputed, but that if a Spectrum or Ghoſt ſhould appear to a very wicked man, ſuppoſe it to be an <hi>aerial Repreſentation of his Companion; who,</hi> with a hollow Voice, dreadful Viſage, and lamentable Utterance, tells him, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102510:95"/>there is a <hi>God,</hi> both juſt and powerful, and that there is an eternally happy, and miſerable ſtate; and that it is his misfortune to be doomed to the latter which, in his life-time, he uſed all the means he could to baniſh from his thoughts; and that if he does not ſpeedily amend his life, and heartily repent of the many wickedneſſes he has wilfully, and preſumptuouſly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they were formerly Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſin, ſo they would be unhappy Fellow-ſufferers, in a lamentable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I queſtion not, but if a Ghoſt ſhould appear to any of us after this manner, it would make ſome impreſſion upon us. But then, whether or no this miracle wrought, would ſo prevail with a man who has habituated himſelf to Wickedneſs, as to work a Reformation in him? It is to be ſuppoſed, No: For after the ſurprize is over, thoſe heats allayed, which were at firſt ſtirred up in him, he will quickly invent excuſes and arguments, why he ſhould not effect that Reformation, he has ſo much averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Tho' he was deeply touched at firſt, and all his Powers in ſuch a conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102510:96"/>that he was ſcarce himſelf, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recovered from the fright, the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he has to ſin will put him <hi>upon doubt and ſcrutiny, and to queſtion the reality of the thing:</hi> He knows not but the Viſion was only the effect of <hi>Melancholy, and a drooping Mind,</hi> or the imagination of a diſtempered Brain. He knows, that when Perſons lie under the extremity of a Fever, their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are very whimſical, and ſuppoſe they ſee frightful ſhapes, &amp; a company of Fiends about their Beds, or that they <hi>ſee Hell open, and abundance of Souls tormenting there.</hi> That ſome, who are naturally frightful, ſuppoſe an Apparition inſtead of their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and will ſcarce be beaten out of that ſtrong Illuſion; and thus the World comes to be filled with <hi>relations of Ghoſts or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions.</hi> He knows that ſome, by ſtrength of fancy, will imagine a <hi>cluſter of Clouds to be an Army of Men ingaged in a pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;</hi> and why may not the Viſion, which he ſaw, be only an imaginative ſhape, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing real, but a thing framed in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Mind? It is eaſie for a Man, who is not willing to believe any thing of this nature, to bring himſelf to ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to evade and ſhift off the thoughts of it, that they might not diſturb and trouble him in his wickedneſſes. But
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102510:96"/>then he is much more encouraged, when he tells his idle and wanton Companions the relation, who, upon hearing it, will not forbear <hi>jeſting him out of the conceit;</hi> nor will they want arguments to convince him, that he was either <hi>in a Dream,</hi> or was penſively muſing, or was imploying his thoughts about Stories which tell of <hi>Ghoſts and Spirits,</hi> and ſo giving way to them, fooliſhly conjectured that his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fancy metamorphos'd it ſelf into <hi>form and ſhape.</hi> But he muſt baniſh all ſuch whimſical Notions, and never credit any thing of that kind, or otherwiſe he muſt forſake their Society, and not <hi>din their ears with ſuch Nonſence,</hi> but thoſe who are eaſie, too credulous Perſons, who ſpend their time in carrying ſuch ridiculous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations up and down the World. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſing, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he cannot eaſily baffle the <hi>credit of his Senſes; for tho' he has hitherto uſed all the means he could, to baniſh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Viſion, yet he cannot be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that there was ſomewhat in it. My blood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would not ſo ſuddenly, without ſome extraordinary cauſe, fly in my face; nor would my powers ruffle together in ſuch confuſion, if ſomething praeter-natural
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102510:97"/>had not made towards me. I was neither a ſleep, nor muſing, but perfectly in my ſenſes, when I ſaw the Apparition; and therefore I cannot deny Matter of Fact.</hi> But ſtill the great love he bears to ſin, will put him upon framing another Argument. It is true, I was amazed at a Viſion, but how do I know that it was <hi>one riſen from the Dead?</hi> It might, peradventure, be a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, dreſs'd up in Grave-cloaths, imitating the walk and geſture of a Ghoſt, who intended, by this Religious fraud, to ſcare me from my ſins; but it ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he could not diſtinguiſh truly between the Impoſture, or the Reality. But ſuppoſing it is no fraud, <hi>but indeed a Spirit,</hi> yet he knows not whether it be his Friend; if he was convinced of this, he would credit his relation, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately change upon it. But, for ought he knows, it may be one of thoſe <hi>evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the Air,</hi> who diſturb and fluſter Men, and poſſeſs them with ſtrange whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, fancies, and frightful imaginations; and therefore, till further conviction to the contrary, he will not be influenced, and wrought upon, by any Spirit of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſince I know, and have heard, that they are maliciouſly bent againſt us, and would do us much more miſchief than
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102510:97"/>they do, if they were not limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by a ſuperior Power. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is not to be doubted, that ſuch a Man as I am now ſpeaking of, will <hi>create and raiſe many Arguments, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the force and influence of ſuch a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wrought in order to his Converſion,</hi> ſo there is one more yet remaining, which he may probably urge, to ſortifie himſelf againſt Conviction and Converſion: And that is, the <hi>unuſualneſs of ſuch kind of means, as a Spirit, or Apparition, to bring Men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> It is true, he has been haunted; but why he, above the reſt of Mankind? <hi>The ſingularity of the thing will increaſe his doubt.</hi> If the Neighbourhood where he lives were thus diſturbed, or if any of his near Acquaintance ſhould come and tell him, that at ſuch a time they were <hi>ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by a Ghoſt,</hi> who told them, That if they continued in that courſe of Life they ſo vigorouſly proſecuted, they would be as miſcrable as himſelf, who ſuffers eternal torments for committing the very ſame ſins they now live in, this relation would indeed alarm him, and make him ſuſpect his preſent circumſtances, and leave thoſe Vices he is diſſ waded from. But ſince none that he knows of are thus handled,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102510:98"/>he has no reaſon to credit the relation of the Spirit. <hi>If ſuch means of Conviction were rational and powerful, doubtleſs others would be afforded them as well as he; but ſince he hears, nor knows of none, he ſhall not take things upon truſt, but continue unperſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as he is.</hi> Thus we ſee how Men, who withſtand the Motives of Chriſtianity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be reformed by <hi>Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles;</hi> will <hi>alſo find out ſhifts and ways to evade the force and argument of a Spirit, ſhould one be ſent on purpoſe to convert them.</hi> And thus is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Anſwer</hi> made good to the <hi>Rich Man,</hi> who importunately deſired him <hi>to ſend</hi> Lazarus <hi>from the dead, to teſtifie to his Brethren, for that they could not withſtand the force of ſuch a Miracle wrought for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> No, ſays <hi>Abraham, If they will not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi> And now I proceed to make ſome ſpecial application of the whole, and then conclude. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We learn the danger of refuſing to be reformed by the publick and ſtanding reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's Will;</hi> that we become ſo de perately hardened, that nothing elſe, no not a Miracle, would have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us, becauſe we diſ-believe that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102510:98"/>Word which is ſo well atteſted by <hi>Moſes and the Prophets, by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the blood of Martyrs; and an Apparition doth not carry along with it ſuch a rational Conviction. Beſides, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard how many ways the force of an argument, drawn from ones appearance from the dead, may be evaded; but now none of theſe pretences can be made againſt the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a ſtanding revelation, ſo well atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confirmed by Miracles, Signs, and Wonders.</hi> It is the fond and vain fancy of ſome, that if they had lived in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours time, and had ſeen him <hi>work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> reſtore the Lame and Paralytick, <hi>raiſe the Dead to Life,</hi> open the Eyes of thoſe that never ſaw, and the like; or if they had ſeen him hanging on the Croſs, in a great agony, and giving up the Ghoſt; or if they had ſeen him after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they ſhould certainly have been Converted, and become eminently holy Perſons. <hi>What a groſs illuſion is this?</hi> If now they will not be reformed by the Motives of the Goſpel, which in time was faithfully penned by the Evangeliſts, who both knew and converſed with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, heard his Sermons, and ſaw thoſe mighty Wonders that he wrought; who were <hi>Witneſſes of his Reſurrection, and held
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102510:99"/>Conferences with him after he roſe from the Dead:</hi> I ſay, if they will not be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Writings of the Evangeliſts, neither would they if they <hi>had lived in the days of our Saviour.</hi> Again; ſome wait for the <hi>powerful influences of the Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> that is, ſin on, till God ſhall pleaſe to turn their hearts. Wherefore look they for any other means, than the Rule of the Scriptures, which, though indeed they are not abſolutely converting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, yet they are in order to it: And we know not any, who prize and venerate the Word of God, make it their conſtant ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and earneſt deſire, to believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and live up to the Rule of Life therein preſcribed, but are enabled, and wonderfully aſſiſted in their pious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And if Men are void of Grace, it is becauſe they make not a right uſe of the <hi>written VVord; which bids them ask, and they ſhall receive; to ſeek and they ſhall find; to knock, and it ſhall be opened: which bids them humbly to read, and ſearch, and in them they ſhall find eternal life.</hi> It is Mens wilfully ſhutting their Eyes, and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hearts againſt the knowledge of the truth, which makes them ſo little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:102510:99"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From what has been ſaid, we learn how guilty and inexcuſable they are who ſtill continue in Inſidelity, or are vicious in their Lives and Converſations, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the goodneſs of God in vouchſafing them the light and liberty of the Goſpel.</hi> What will theſe kind of Men be able to plead for themſelves, when they are, by the <hi>ſound of the laſt Trump,</hi> ſummoned to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Will they vainly pretend that the Word of God was not influential enough, or the Motives uſed therein too weak to work upon them? Their own Hearts will confute them, and too plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their own ſtubbornneſs. How faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or perverſe ſoever Men be in this life, yet in the <hi>other they will be more ſlexible and believing;</hi> and to their own ſhame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that God Almighty did all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch a Being to make them happy; that nothing was left undone, or that was neceſſary to convince their Reaſon and Underſtanding; but it was their petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant follies, obſtinate perverſeneſſes, and treacherous infidelities, <hi>preſumptuouſly ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their eyes,</hi> and hardening their hearts, which were the cauſe of their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>How will the Rich Man, and his five Brethren,</hi> riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch Infidels! <hi>They would not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102510:100"/>the Prophets;</hi> but theſe would not believe, neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Prophets, nor Jeſus Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles. The <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> never watered with the Dew of Heavenly Doctrine, will riſe up in Judgment againſt them, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more knowledge of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, than they learn from the <hi>Book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> live more morally than many of us do. Certainly ſuch Men have no thought, how they ſhall be able to ſtand before the Son of Man when he comes to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they do not conſider what it is to appear before the tremendous Bar of Juſtice unprepared, there to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Sins of a whole Life,</hi> and not one of them repented of. To appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an earthly Judge in a bad Cauſe, and to be too well convinced that there are <hi>Witneſſes enough to condemn us;</hi> this is Matter of great Trouble and Concern, and makes a Man very uneaſie: But to appear before the <hi>Judge of Judges, who ſits upon eternal Life and Death,</hi> as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, who lived and died ſo, and to have the <hi>glorious Company of the Apoſtles, the goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army of Martyrs, a great Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt us,</hi> is infinitely more fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102510:100"/>and terrible. And, O, the great Condemnation of thoſe, who have a long time lived under the <hi>ſound and preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> and have had the tenders of Salvation again and again offered to them! It had been better for them, if they had never been born; <hi>it ſhall be much more tolerable, in the day of Judgment, for the</hi> Sodomites <hi>and</hi> Sidonians, <hi>than for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude; As we hope to fare well, <hi>when Jeſus Chriſt comes to Judge the World;</hi> as we would, that he ſhould ſay unto us, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servants, enter ye into the Joy of your Lord: Let us be all convinced by the publick and ſtanding Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God's Will; that is, by the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. So, when he who is our Life ſhall appear, we alſo ſhall appear with him in Glory,</hi> Now to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, be given all Honour, Praiſe, Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Obedience, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
